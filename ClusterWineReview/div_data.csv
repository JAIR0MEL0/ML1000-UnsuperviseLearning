"163","France","As with Clos de Vougeot in red, every producer needs a Corton-Charlemagne white. Aegerter's contribution is soft, honeyed and warm.

"167","France","A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040.",95,50,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4

The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",95,45,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4

This is linear and totally toned, majoring in the tart and invigorating end of the citrus spectrum. All the more excitement for us. Notions of wet stone pop up and remain on the palate.

"228","Argentina","This is a more rustic, woody Cabernet than many from Mendoza. The nose suggests asphalt, herbs and spice more than bright fruit.

The palate continues in the same fruit-driven vein with that pure, ripe but tart apple note that seems to be such a feature of Alsace Riesling.

"231","France","A pure startling cherry note rises from the glass. It is flanked by notes of autumn forest, tar and dried orange rind. Evidently, there is some development and evolution here. The palate is alive and fills not only the mouth but all the senses with its alluring aromas, yet it is firmly anchored in earthier tones.

"235","Chile","Strongly briny and raw on the nose, with an insistent aroma of tomato sauce, this cool-region Pinot is austere at first, then dry, raw and snappy by the midpalate.

"237","France","A big, ripe, still very young wine with black fruits that are right up front. It's jammy and juicy, with almost as much fruit as tannin.

"240","Chile","Aromas of petrol and tropical fruits are pithy and a touch bitter, but are clearly those of Riesling. A crisp, acid-ripped palate runs long, with lime, lychee and stony flavors.

"246","France","The nose merely hints at tropical riches. The stony palate also holds tightly onto its fruit: it is only zesty citrus that can be divined amidst all the stone. Bright lemon shines above what seems a deep dark core of rocky earth. There is real drive and real energy in that bright, lemony vein that runs right through this dry, serious and almost brooding wine.

"260","Argentina","Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth, this is typically angular, with sharp acidity and not much cushion.

Its pithy texture carries beautifully into a dry, zesty, citrus-tinged finish, feeling clean and moreish.",90,23,"Niederösterreich","Riesling",48.108077,15.8049558,3
"314","France","Full in the mouth, this rich wine comes from vineyards in the hillside valley above Puligny-Montrachet. It has something of the same balance between ripe fruit and a steely texture.

"315","France","Slightly funky notions appear first: There's a hint of reduction but this, thankfully, blows off. Underneath sits a very sprightly, very fresh wine that pits fruity apple mellowness against total, dry freshness. This has a concentrated core, the aromas are still a little tinged by the flinty, smoky hints of reduction but this will stand them in good stead for cellar age. Give this some time.

"316","Italy","Leafy underbrush, new leather, dark berry and chopped herb aromas waft out of the glass. The fresh, chewy palate doles out succulent wild cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon notes, blanketed in smooth, round tannins. A licorice note caps off the finish.

"317","Australia","Austere, tannic and chewy, this Cabernet could use a few years in the cellar.

"318","France","Subtle hints of tart apples appear first, then there is the merest touch of quince, even a touch of lemon balm. The palate pans out aromatically, always in that apple and quince spectrum, and has a brightening crisp edge of freshness and absolute concentration and dryness. With more air, the aromatic lemon balm note adds its special perfume to this wine. This is invigorating and enlivening.",93,38,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4

"330","Italy","Cedar, black currants, prune and tobacco aromas unfold in the glass. The warm, forward palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, black pepper and tobacco alongside astringent tannins. While the tannins need to unwind, it's shy on fresh acidity and the fruit is starting to dry up—a result of the hot vintage—so drink sooner rather than later.",87,35,"Tuscany","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"333","Spain","Creamy oak aromas shout “vanilla” and “wood resin” in full voice. This is a rough wine with stampeding tannins.

"336","France","Very earthy notes precede a subdued nose of citrus zest. These tart but expressive notes open up a little more on the palate where they are joined by a rounded, if crunchy structure. There is ample freshness here but also an earthy and (for now) citrus-fruited generosity. The finish reverts to stony, earthy cleanness. This is intriguing and needs time to unfold its fruit and unusual texture. Drink 2020–2030",93,30,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"337","France","A very pure but subtle note of Golden Delicious apple hits the nose. The palate rounds out this ripe but tart flavor but also brightens it with lovely apple crispness and freshness.

"763","Australia","Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that.

"764","Spain","The last Altos that was this good came in 2004; this vintage is on a par with that superb wine courtesy of deep plum, mocha and marzipan aromas. This is a modern Rioja with impeccable balance despite being huge and tannic.

"771","France","A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness.

This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.",95,60,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"772","France","Incredibly pure notes of freshly cut Cox's Orange Pippin assail the nose. The palate has the same purity and a linear, taut, rich but toned body that is yet to reveal all of its secrets. The purity and luminoisty of the fruit is astonishing.

"774","France","Fresh notes of crunchy red cherry have a spicy edge of pepper. The body of this slender Pinot Noir is very light, totally peppery and very appetizing.

"775","France","An aromatic hint of pine mixes with the red cherry notes on the nose, creating a very appetizing opening. The ultralight palate is translucent and slender, with the same leafy conifer aromas and lots and lots of red currant brightness and freshness.

"1044","Australia","This wine provides plenty of drinking pleasure for a moderate tariff.

The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element.

"1197","Argentina","Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign.

Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.",88,25,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1198","Austria","Loess soil, fine silt derived from glacial deposits, is the core characteristic of the Wagram vineyards. With Riesling's ability to take its varietal flavor from the soil, this wine shows richness and opulence, while still keeping close to fresh apples and spice flavors. It's young, but already drinkable.",88,22,"Donauland","Riesling",47.516231,14.550072,3
"1199","Australia","Though the nose is a pretty combination of almond, meat and citrus, this Chard's steely, angular frame carries more than its share of buttered-toast flavors.

"1203","Italy","This Riserva Syrah exhibits aged aromas of spice, old leather and dried pipe tobacco.

"1205","Argentina","Robust and with a touch of raisin, this full-bodied Cab hits many correct notes.

"1209","Australia","Though other tasting panelists liked it better, I can't get on board with the raisin-bran element that pervades this wine, nose to finish.

"1223","Spain","Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish. In a world where so many wines are going ripe and heavy, this one holds steady to the traditional. So if you're looking for an old-school Spanish red to go with tortilla espanola or lamb chops, this will do the trick.",87,17,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"1224","Austria","The Kraxn (pronounced “KRAX-en”) is well-placed for Riesling, with its southern exposure close to the Danube river.

"1227","Australia","This is the rarest of all finds: a high-quality Pinot Noir at an everyday price.

"1229","Argentina","Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas.

"1230","Australia","A solid, well-made offering, Grant Burge's unoaked Chardonnay offers a medium-bodied mouthful of authoritative flavor at a reasonable price.

"1231","Spain","With its black plum, blackberry and other bold, juvenile aromas, this bargain-priced Spaniard shows flavors of chocolate, natural bitterness and good overall balance. A little big and brawny, but better than washed out and weak. A classic chorizo or hamburger wine.",86,6,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1

"1233","Spain","The Eguren brothers of Sierra Cantabria and other projects always do a nice job with this Tempranillo from central Spain.

"1236","Argentina","Quite piercing and fiery at first, which announces that it is fully oaked. Along the way there's savory notes, saucy leather and flashes of dark fruit.

"1237","Italy","Little doubt from the nose what the grape was: archetypal Sauvignon Blanc. Lots of hay, wet grass a touch of green plums.

"1240","Argentina","Starts out all rowdy and sweaty, with animal hide and warm earth. And that all makes sense: this is unoaked, unmolested Syrah and thus it has its funky side. Along the roadside there's blackberry and pepper flavors and peppy acids and tannins. An interesting ride that's not without its ups and downs.",86,18,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"1242","Italy","Gorgeous stuff; the real deal in terms of meaty, modern Chianti. And from an excellent year, which explains why it's so saturated and rich.

It is deep, full-bodied and packed with tobacco, chocolate and Tuscan sunshine.",93,38,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"1243","Italy","Inky and raw, but in the best way. This is an unbridled, unchained monster of a Chianti, one with impeccable depth and extraction but also one that doesn't sit on your palate like dead weight. Racy acids and firm tannins work in tandem to prop up the bulky dark fruit, creating a structured, delicious mass. Drink from 2007 through 2015.",92,55,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"1244","New Zealand","This ambitious international effort has yet to really take off—at least in its New Zealand incarnation.

"1247","Argentina","A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit.

Pours on the oak but in an integrated way; very good for varietal Cab from 2008.",89,20,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1248","Argentina","Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",89,79,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1249","Argentina","Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness.

"1252","Argentina","Spunky and funky on the nose, with some heat and bramble. There's definitely a gamy side to this wine, but as it airs it picks up more of Malbec's trademark feel and fruit.

Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",88,19,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1262","Argentina","For an average vintage this is an average wine. It has some bramble, leather and mild green notes to the nose, which are backed by red-fruit and brambly flavors. The feel is fresh and racy due to firm acids. Not the most expressive wine going, but nobody is going to call it flat or flabby.",85,49,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

"1276","Argentina","The wood is a bit forced, and overall this wine has a heavy, full-fruited personality. But the depth and ripeness are pretty nice and the blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors are earnest. A bit tannic and not all that varietal.",85,9,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"1279","Italy","This wine delivers bang for the buck as well as fine characteristics. On the bouquet, there's leather, black cherry and so much depth it's as if you're looking down a well. Juicy yet firm on the palate, with plum, raspberry and chocolate flavors. Soft tannins don't mean it's flabby; rather they offer early drinkability.",90,22,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"1280","Italy","Begins with a blast of bright cherry fruit, backed by subtle leather and tobacco aromas, before subsiding into a creamy mouthful of cherries and vanila. A slight herbal note adds complexity. Finish is rich and filled with supple tannins.",90,32,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"1281","Italy","On the border of overdone, this is one intense ripe, pruney wine that carries just enough acid and tannin to rank as a crowd pleaser. Secondary flavors or root beer, pepper, raisin and dried herbs are luring, while the smooth finish is graced by leather and tea. Really settles in after ten minutes of airing.",90,29,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"1282","Italy","A bit bulky and roasted, but that brings with it tobacco, earth and chocolate aromas. Expressive on the palate; the plum and berry fruit is exciting and braced by serious tannins. Those tannins are also a bit drying, so the finish seems tight as nails. Deserves air and time after opening.",90,26,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"1287","Spain","Vanilla and dill aromas are front and center. The palate imparts plum skin and red-apple flavors, with lots of rough tannins holding the feel hostage.

"1293","Argentina","A little charred and bulky, but pretty good for a basic New World Cabernet. The nose is a mix of ripe fruit, licorice and herbs, while the palate is tame and veers to strawberry. Simple and a touch herbal.",84,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1294","Argentina","Good but sort of generic. The nose exudes strawberry and milk chocolate, and the palate features blueberry fruit and some citrus-like acidity.

"1295","Argentina","Fairly sweet on the nose, with plum and a touch of spice. Things get more rugged in the mouth, where cherry and blackberry flavors carry a medicinal edge. A big Syrah but also a clumsy, heavy-handed one. Proceed with caution.",83,15,"Other","Syrah",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"1296","Argentina","Novus' basic Cab is probably a better wine for the money. This one seems to want to justify its reserve status by offering more oak. But that oak carries that creamy vanilla and carob flavor, making the wine sticky. And maybe the raw material is a bit overripe as well.",83,15,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1297","Argentina","Not sure exactly what's happening at Bianchi in San Rafael. A few years back Bianchi's wines were almost all exemplary but lately they've been all over the map. This overoaked, charred Cabernet is a perfect example of a wine without a cause.

"1301","Argentina","Blackberry, rubber and a suggestion of minerality work well as an invitation to this juicy, woody wine that's long and full in the mouth, with dark-fruit flavors of black cherry, blackberry and plum. Woody and toasty, too, but dry and spicy rather than sweet, blowsy and creamy. A nice Malbec for all occasions.",88,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1302","Argentina","Minty, oaky and spicy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that are potent.

"1304","Argentina","All in all this isn't a bad little wine for the price.

"1307","Argentina",". The citrus and grapefruit aromas come across a little mealy and the wine never really rises above its candied citrus and apple cider qualities. It is pretty good on the tongue, however, and feels juicy. If chilled down it won't be a bad quaff.",83,14,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"1311","Argentina","Wines can be big and loaded with everything, yet still be hard to enjoy. This is a case in point: It weighs in at 15% and brings searing aromas of tree bark, char and shoe polish.

"1322","Argentina","Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas. That leads to a tannic, semisharp palate with spunky blackberry fruit that comes with spice and chocolate shadings.

"1359","Argentina","Slightly sharp and herbal upon first impression, with green herb and field-like aromas along with rubbery, earthy black fruit. The palate is mulled and a touch edgy, with herbal, lightly stemmy berry flavors. Decent as a whole, but sort of sharp, herbal and stemmy for a higher-end wine.",85,24,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1360","France","This wine reveals the intense acidity of the 2007 vintage, while managing to balance that juiciness with solid tannins. With its acidity, it can age for over 3–4 years.",91,34,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"1361","Argentina","Smells a bit heavy, oily and like dry cornflakes. The palate is  straightforward, with tropical, candied flavors of mango, banana and sweet melon. Sweetness is the key here; it's all over the palate and finish.",85,20,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"1362","Argentina","Murky and leathery on first take, with dry, earthy red fruit aromas emerging later on. The palate is fresh enough, with snappy acidity and tannic bite along with wan, mild fruit flavors and spice. Perfectly adequate but short on stuffing and depth.",85,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

After the brushy, herbal aromas comes a juicy, crisp red fruit palate with raspberry and plum flavors but also a bit of green at the core. Finishes bold but a little hot and scratchy.",85,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1364","Chile","Smooth and earthy on the nose, with tobacco, cola and restrained red-berry aromas. Has depth and the right amount of snap to the palate, which features classic flavors of herb, spice, tobacco, cedar and berry fruit.

"1367","Argentina","Lean, mildly green aromas offer minimal fruit, and there's a salinic, swimming pool set of aromas as well. The palate is fairly thick and solid, with big tannins and flavors of candied fruits and carob that lean toward green. Shows big body and weight, but the nose is only fair while the flavors are herbal.",84,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1368","France","A very fine wine with some bottle age that has given the dense tannins a chance to integrate beautifully into its sweet fruit. There is a bitter chocolate edge that comes from the wood aging. It has a dark and very structured aftertaste.",91,29,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"1369","Portugal","This is a minty, aromatic Syrah, with tannins that are laced with violet and blackberry flavors. It's finely structured, and shows a spice charcter from the fruit that combines easily with the wood toast. Age for 4 years.",91,38,"Tejo","Syrah",39.7528442,-5.2532284,3
"1370","Argentina","More leafy and mulchy than ideal, with coffee, herbal notes and a light green quality to the nose. The feel is starchy, and the flavors run burnt, mildly green and sweet, with a pasty, sticky finish. Has some merit but also falls a little short.",84,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

Herbal on the finish, but not offensive or difficult to drink.",84,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1375","France","Lean, earthy, rustic wine, dominated by beetroot and black currant juice. Its tannins are a dusty core with acidity and berry fruit flavors around it. If the rustic character can blow off, it's an attractive, balanced wine.",84,17,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4

"1381","France","A big, bold wine that is full of dense fruit and sweet berry flavors. It has weight and richness, the structure stuffed with pure, ripe Malbec fruit that has not been in wood. Delicious and worth aging 2–3 years.",90,18,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"1382","Portugal","An impressive Pinot Noir that brings out plenty of the varietal's characteristics: the strawberry fruit flavors, the structure and the acidity.

"1389","Argentina","Roasted and leathery on the nose, without much fruit. The palate is full, rubbery and baked tasting, with herbal berry flavors. Finishes cooked and heavy as well, with a sauciness that overrides any freshness of fruit. A downer compared to the fresher 2008 version.",82,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1390","Argentina","Strained on the nose, with dirty fruit aromas, gaseousness and candy. The palate is cloying and confected, with muddy, jammy, herbal fruit flavors and a cooked, weedy finish. Bulky but not very good.",82,14,"Mendoza Province","Merlot",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1391","Argentina","Black in color, with a severe, jammy nose that's ominous and heavy. The look and bouquet portend the flavors, which are thick, raisiny and pruney.

"1395","France","Although 2006 won't go down as a great vintage in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's selections parcellaires are still top notch. Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries.

"1517","France","A wine that brings out intense minerality, a tight citric tang and a beautiful structure.

"1519","Chile","Saturated purple in color and grapy on the nose. The palate is mouthfilling but carries semisharp acidity, and the flavors run in the direction of standard black fruit.

"1520","Spain","Raisin, black plum and peppery aromas make for a good bouquet, and the palate is healthy and dark, with snappy black cherry and blackberry flavors floating on a current of zesty acidity.

"1631","Argentina","A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents.

"1632","Argentina","An interesting but questionable value with Patagonian individuality.

"1641","Argentina","More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs.

Drink now.",87,25,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"1650","Argentina","Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.",87,24,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"1675","Argentina","Slightly earthy and herbal smelling but with enough clean fruit on the nose to make the grade.

It's slightly dry and leafy, but it's bright and fresh in the mouth, with good balance.",85,8,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3

"1690","Spain","This single-vineyard Rioja always impresses through its impeccable balance, depth of aromas and richness. Aromas of jammy blackberry come with blueberry, orange peel, graham cracker and graphite. It's tight and mildly tannic, with pure boysenberry, cassis, roasted plum, charred spice and toast flavors.

"1694","Argentina","Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel.

"1695","Argentina","Sweet and baked smelling, with foxy core aromas that suggest wet dog fur. The palate is loud and wild, with foxy, unsettled flavors of wild berry and cherry. Runs low on layering, structure and body, but it is lively.",84,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1696","France","The vintage as well as the vineyard gave this hugely rich wine. It has weight, concentrated fruit and toast flavors, the acidity on line right through the center.

"1703","Argentina","Charred and smells of coffee, toasted oak, minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic, with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest.

It's inoffensive but not worth much attention. Finishes a bit vegetal as well.",83,12,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"1710","France","A closed, structured wine, revealing the steely side of Chablis rather than the richness of 2009. It has intense citrus fruit flavors, the acidity an important element along with the wood. However, it is the minerality that dominates, resulting in a taut, textured wine that needs five years aging.",92,120,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

"1715","Argentina","The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice.

"1834","Chile","It's pretty easy pegging this for Chilean SB; the nose is full of grass, lettuce leaf and bell pepper along with citrus. Feels fresh and deep, with good cut and pointed flavors of green bean and lychee. Runs heavy on the bell pepper and capsicum.",86,12,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"1835","New Zealand","Spy Valley's 2007 Envoy Pinot Noir is an attractive wine, featuring an exterior of brown sugar, dry leaves and coffee and a fruit-filled cherry center. The only concern is the slightly drying finish and some slightly coarse, rustic tannins. If those resolve gracefully, this rating may look stingy in 3 years' time.",86,55,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"1836","Spain","Solid on the opening, with red fruit aromas and a mild stalkiness. Feels healthy and medium in weight, with mild oak, fresh plum and berry, and a touch of cocoa for flavors. Dry and crisp on the finish, with leftover oak flavor and good balance.",86,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"1837","New Zealand","This is slightly bigger and earthier than Ara's other 2009 Pinot Noir, with notes more of beet than cherry, and hints of dried herbs and mushrooms. It's a sturdy wine that could stand up to braised meats.",86,15,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"1838","New Zealand","This Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc is very easy to drink, if slightly lacking distinctiveness. Melon and fig flavors finish on a slightly grassy note, while the texture is plump and soft.",86,13,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"1839","Spain","Opaque in color, with blackberry and licorice aromas but also a distinct streak of brambly herbs and green. Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray. This is a commendable modern Rioja but it does have a few issues, namely a green herbal component.",86,24,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"1840","Chile","Smells roasted and spicy, with an herbal, brushy character. Tannic and tight in the mouth, with pinching grip and flavors of herbal plum and berry.

"1841","Spain","Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.",85,17,"Northern Spain","Merlot",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"1842","Spain","Bold, forward and extracted red wine, with raspberry, earth, compost and a light leafiness to the nose. Tannic and tight, with plum and heavy, ripe berry flavors. Toasty and dark on the finish too, with power and freshness.",85,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"1843","New Zealand","Sourced from a high-altitude vineyard near the top of the Awatere Valley, this wine shows some of the leafiness characteristic of the region. The fruit is more roasted root vegetable than tree fruit, with a potent savory and fairly muscular character.",86,22,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"1854","Australia","Yes, a certain amount of acidity is desirable in Australian Riesling, but this one is exceedingly lean and crisp. Perhaps it will blossom with age, but for now it is simply intensely citrusy and rather skinny.

"1855","New Zealand","This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc features some nice lime and grapefruit flavors, but it turns tart, chalky and almost metallic on the finish. It's certainly zesty, but it clangs off the rim instead of swooshing straight on through.",84,20,"Martinborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3
"1856","New Zealand","Disappointing after the success of last year's version, Kato's 2009 is a lightweight Sauvignon Blanc with herbal, bell-peppery component. There's a tart stridency on the finish that will serve it well with some dishes, less so with others.",84,13,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"1861","Spain","Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region. The palate shows generic, herbal black fruit and the finish is acceptable.",83,7,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1

"1864","Spain","Strawberry and rhubarb aromas get it going, and frankly that's about as good as it gets.

"1867","France","A wine that has created its own universe. It has a unique, special softness that allies with the total purity that comes from a small, enclosed single vineyard. The fruit is almost irrelevant here, because it comes as part of a much deeper complexity. This is a great wine, at the summit of Champagne, a sublime, unforgettable experience.",100,1400,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"1868","Spain","A bit scratchy up front, with some heat and rubber to the bouquet. Feels bold, grippy and alive, with lightly herbal flavors of roasted berry and leather. Herbal and blackened on the finish; ripe but basic in quality.",84,8,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1

"1870","Spain","Smells decidedly burnt and stalky, with rubbery berry and black plum aromas.

"1884","France","This is the top wine from Fabien Jouves's estate. There is some new wood aging here and it shows in the polished edges of the very firm tannins.

The nose is deep, dense and black as night, with olive, tobacco, coconut and bold black fruit aromas. The palate is racy and tannic, and the flavors of plum, cassis, blackberry, chocolate, prune and fig are elevated.

"1942","Australia","Prices have soared for this bottling, which used to be an excellent value within the Penfolds stable.

"1945","Chile","Juniper and eucalyptus aromas are front and center on this dark-tinted Syrah that also brings aromas of olive, blackberry and coffee. A sinewy, tight palate has little give to it, while flavors of toasty oak and spice wrestle with herbal plum and berry notes.

"2407","Argentina","A lot of oak. The nose is honeyed and heavy, with too much toast and butter. In the mouth, it's got kicking acids but the flavors are sweet, oaky and veer toward banana. Resiny on the finish; underwhelming for the price.",84,21,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2

"2502","New Zealand","A rare Marlborough Merlot, this is a superficially charming wine that shows cassis fruit and lashings of smoky, cedary oak.

"2538","Spain","For an '04 reserva, this wine is more edgy, grabby and high in acid than expected. The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum.

Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish.

It offers a bundled concentration of flavor and fruit, and a straight backbone of acidity pervades everything with a sense of purity. Right now, fresh citrus notes of lemon pith, peel and flesh dominate aromatically, but this will blossom. There are already inklings of honey and orange in the background but only time will reveal what cabinet of wonders is hidden here. Drink 2017–2025.",93,55,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4

One of the best in its class.",89,11,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3

"2651","Argentina","Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing.

"2716","Argentina","Extravagantly floral on the nose, with blueberry, mineral and other particular aromas. But once you hit the palate, the acidity is extreme and thus the mouthfeel is sheering.

"2725","Spain","Nice, simple and fruity, with nothing but standard raspberry fruit and good mouthfeel up its sleeve.

"2836","France","Opulent, ripe, cherry-flavored Pinot that just demands to be enjoyed. The red fruits burst out of the glass, given a fillip by acidity.

"3055","France","Winemaker Pierre Jehan's interpretation of Corton-Charlemagne for Henri de Villamont is to retain great fruit, but not to produce a wine with too much weight.

Tannic and full-bodied, and tasting of roasted black fruits with a generous sprinkling of baking spices. Chunky, tannic and arguably a little saucy/soupy on the finish. Best if you like big, roasted, chubby wines.",88,13,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3129","Chile","A pure and proper Cabernet with aromas of balsam wood, toast, berry and cassis. There's some power and kick on the palate, but the overall feel is good. So are the flavors of cassis, raspberry and plum. Spicy on the finish, with a bit of piquant heat.",88,12,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3130","New Zealand","Matariki's 2008 is a medium-bodied, slightly grassy effort, with ripe passion fruit and nectarine flavors framed by subtle hints of smoke and herb.

"3133","Chile","Herbal on the nose, with basil and tomato leaf aromas. The palate feel is reasonably good if a bit hollow, while the flavors reflect the bouquet via dry, herbal, peppery red fruit. Spicy with green olive and standard red berry on the finish.",85,12,"Curicó Valley","Merlot",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3

"3135","Spain","Opens with sharp cherry, cola and mint aromas. The palate is fairly acidic and sheering, but it's also zesty and fresh, with clean berry and mild raisin flavors. Offers reasonably good length, with an acidic choppiness balanced by good fruit flavors.",85,16,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3136","France","This is the second wine of Château de Mercuès, and it has some of the same concentration and tannins as the first wine, without the huge and powerful structure. It will develop its black cherry and spice flavors relatively quickly, to yield a ready-to-drink wine in 2–3 years.",88,16,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"3137","Chile","Dusty and a bit odd on the nose, this has a strange whiff of perfume and resiny oak. The palate is round and layered, with some minerality. Flavors of apple, pear and quince come with a lot of vanilla and raw oak. The finish follows suit with toast and resiny flavors.",88,23,"Limarí Valley","Chardonnay",-30.7462002,-71.0022311,2

"3144","France","Rich, intense red-fruited wine, soft and voluptuous. The tannins are folded into the ripe fruits, giving a very approachable feel. The acidity is prominent at this stage but should soften in a year or two, and the wine is certainly worth aging.",91,55,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4

"3146","Argentina","A sniff is rewarded with sandalwood, dry spice and thick, jammy berry aromas.

"3147","Argentina","Graphite and lead pencil aromas mix with toasty berry scents.

"3148","France","Ripe, rich and soft, this is an opulent wine from a warm year. The acidity is there, masked by toast, apricot and melon flavors. It is already drinkable, likely to continue to age over 3–4 years.",91,70,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3149","France","Bouchard Aîné's whites have progressed well in quality, and this soft, plump Chassagne-Montrachet is a good example. It has weight, a finely judged feel for toast, which fits well with the white peach and spice flavors. The finish is full but fresh. Imported by Boisset America.",88,80,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3150","France","It is sometimes forgotten that Chassagne-Montrachet also produces red wines. Louis Latour's wine presents a fine structure, soft and fresh acidity and ripe, jammy berry flavors. There is a good core of dryness that suggests aging for 2–3 years.",88,25,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3151","Australia","A prime example of what Margaret River is capable of, this is a full-bodied, supple yet tannic Cabernet Sauvignon at a fair price.

"3153","New Zealand","A consistent performer from year to year, Villa Maria's 2009 Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc hints at asparagus, which kept my enthusiasm a little more limited than in the past. But there's ample grapefruit and bright Green Gage plum on the finish.",87,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"3155","Chile","Leather, horse hide, spice, smoked meat and rich berry fruit aromas make for a thick, chunky bouquet.

"3157","Spain","Starts with aromas of beef jerky, licorice and berry syrup. It's a brawny, dark wine with jammy blackberry flavors along with chocolate cake and thick, grabbing tannins. Finishes sweet and syrupy, with heavy saturation and big tannins. Not in perfect balance and by no means a great wine from Mauro. But it's still good for an off year.

Simple but perfectly good for everyday drinking.",85,9,"Curicó Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"3161","Chile","This juicy white opens with a blend of citrusy and grassy aromas. The mouthfeel is healthy and round, with good acidic cut.

"3162","France","The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.",91,90,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3163","France","Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge.",91,90,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3164","Chile","Like all Max Reserva wines, this is intense and powerful. So if the nose is boisterous and oily and full of tar at first, just give it a while to settle down. In the mouth, the wine is balanced and full, with cassis, berry and chocolate flavors. At the end, tobacco and fine herbs enter the picture, making the finish as nice as the early acts.",90,21,"Aconcagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3
"3165","France","Warm, soft, green plum-flavored wine, stiffened with toast and almonds. There is a mineral core, the tannins from pear skins offering spice as well as structure.

"3166","France","A real strawberry-flavored wine, full of soft sweetness and pure fresh flavors. The wine bursts with fruit, the tannins just enough but in definite second place.

"3168","France","Now at its best, this is a wine showing tannins, dry raisins as well as tense acidity. It is mature, ripe, definitely ready for drinking. It has secondary flavors of prunes, wood and smokiness, while the dryness at the core suggests it will not mature much longer.",91,119,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3169","Argentina","Chocolate and charcoal aromas form a dark and masculine greeting. There's also coffee and an herbal note to the nose.

The tannins are dark, with some sweetness as well as final acidity.",91,240,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3171","France","Ripe, sweet-fruited wine, its red berry fruits and opulent tannins giving a rounded feel. There is, as well, a good structure composed of acidity, licorice and wood.

"3173","Australia","Get one thing straight: if you prefer a ramrod structure to your Cabernet, look elsewhere.

"3177","Chile","A little soapy on the nose, with air freshener, cherry candy and soft berry aromas. The palate follows what the nose offers with richness and soft tannins along with blackberry and blueberry flavors. Not very spicy for a Syrah; it's more of a baked, toasty, generic red wine that tastes good but isn't complex or varietal in nature.",87,19,"Aconcagua Valley","Syrah",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3

"3180","Chile","Try as I might, I haven't been able to jump on board this wine since it debuted three harvests ago. The nose is minerally but short on fruit, which pretty much describes the wine.

"3182","New Zealand","For under $10, this is a medium-bodied, slightly soft Sauvignon Blanc that's a good introduction to Marlborough.

"3183","Chile","Black-fruit aromas are matched and ultimately outweighed by oak-based chocolate and vanilla. This feels grabby and rubbery, with oaky flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla. A creamy, resiny finish with chocolate and spice flavors wraps things up.",85,12,"Cachapoal Valley","Syrah",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3
"3184","Chile","Initially, this is heavily stewed and herbal, with aromas of tomato sauce, basil and oregano along with sweet oak and graphite. In the mouth, it feels pinched and reduced.

"3185","France","This is Bouchard's hallmark Beaune, a blend from different premier cru vineyards. The wine is dense, firm and dominated by dark tannins, which offer good aging potential.

"3191","Argentina","Smells ripe and friendly, sort of like a jelly doughnut. The palate is creamy, dense and balanced, with saturated berry and spice flavors.

A complete wine at every turn.",90,19,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3192","France","This walled vineyard has produced a surprisingly tannic, if impressive, wine for a Savigny in this vintage.

"3194","Chile","Smoky smelling and toasty, with peach, melon and cider aromas.

The fruit is ripe, hinting at almonds, with just a light toast edge. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",88,29,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3208","France","Initially spicy, this wine then develops an awkward barnyard character that is hard to shake off. The tannins are firm, dry, but sit at one side of the wine, leaving bitter fruit. This is a tough wine, not properly in balance.",88,108,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3209","France","Smooth, creamy wine, with rounded white fruits that float easily over the judicious light toast flavor. The wine has some richness, but the mineral character of Chablis is there, giving the wine delicious fruit structure. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",88,33,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3210","France","Soft and rounded, given extra richness by the vanilla from wood, this is a ripe wine with yellow fruit and pink grapefruit flavors. As the wine develops it shows an edge of taut acidity, giving a frisson of freshness on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",88,59,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3211","France","Intense, concentrated wine with herbaceous flavors allied to gooseberry, pink grapefruit and a steely edge of acidity. With its powerful fruits, it is worth aging for a few months.",90,20,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"3212","France","A firmly tannic wine, the ripe fruit surrounded by a dry shell. It is already showing the firm chunky character of Nuits-St-Georges, with its dark plum and bitter cherry fruits well into the complex mix of flavors. Age for at least three years.",90,42,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3213","France","A finely textured wine, with its acidity and apple fruits laced with wood and spice. It is rich, full in the mouth, a wine that has great pure flavors, very clear right to the end. Screwcap.",90,40,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3214","Spain","A little raisiny, but it's also very nice for a sun-drenched Tempranillo that's deep, lush, extracted and ready to drink. Flavors of brown sugar, spice and sweet blackberry are ready, while the finish offers fudge and more brown sugar. Doesn't have a long follow-through but it's still a dandy modern wine for the near term.",90,35,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3215","Spain","Big, toasty, spicy and loaded with savory berry aromas, smoke and density. The palate is weighty and saturated, but balanced. Flavorwise, it's dealing sweet, jammy, slightly roasted black fruit tastes that are followed by a spicy, toasty, coffee-driven finish. Meaty and ripe; drink now through 2013.",90,27,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"3218","Chile","If you don't mind a bit of herbal character, this is a nice, easy drinking Syrah with raspberry and cherry aromas and timidity as opposed to a forceful attack. Zesty berry fruit rules the palate, which finishes in round, roasted form. Nice but sort of generic.",87,8,"Rapel Valley","Syrah",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"3219","Chile","Rubber and earth aromas lead to a mix of berry fruit scents and a pinch of vinegar. It's firm in the mouth, with cranberry and herbal raspberry flavors. Gives about as much as it can but at the same time it shows a tart, basic, mildly herbal DNA.",84,10,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3220","Spain","Sweet, candied, minty and easygoing on the nose, then crisp and fresh in the mouth, with basic, stripped-down plum, berry and citrus flavors. Finishes fruity and fresh, with a mild candied sweetness.",84,7,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3221","Spain","A big, jammy youngster with earth and rubber on the nose. Firm, bullish and tannic but also lively, dark-fruited and touched up with bacon. Finishes with heat and bitterness. Meaty and rugged yet still pretty good.",84,8,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3222","Australia","Delivers rather standard Chardonnay aromas and flavors, ranging from hints of toast to ripe peaches and pineapple. It's nicely balanced, showing some lush texture on the midpalate yet retaining citrusy freshness on the finish. Well done, and well priced. Drink now.",87,14,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"3223","Chile","A little rubbery at first, but then it unfolds with floral, blackberry and tar aromas. Fairly dynamic in terms of feel, with elevated red-fruit flavors balanced by oak and chocolate. Firm and peppery on the back end, with lasting notes of cassis. For $15 this is pretty fine Cabernet. Imported by Republic National Distributors.",89,15,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3224","Australia","This fine offering from Victoria's Mornington Peninsula nails Pinot Noir's elusive texture, gliding across the palate in a silky veil. Cherry-berry fruit is framed by hints of brown sugar, coffee and vanilla, but the oak should integrate with a few more months' aging.",89,40,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"3225","Chile","Up until now we haven't been real fond of the Oops brand from Chile. However, this Sauvignon Blanc is exactly what we like. It starts with a basic but comfortable blend of citrusy aromas before showing a complete palate consisting of apple, grapefruit, celery and white pepper flavors. A totally solid wine with no gaps. Level and delicious, with proper bite and scour.",89,12,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"3226","France","Rich and also delicious, this is true Chambolle. The wine revels in its rich, ripe, soft fruits, its flavors of wild strawberries and plum jelly. Of course, there are tannins, a core of dryness, but the exuberant fruit dominates this already delicious wine.",89,95,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3227","France","An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine. Just don't drink it yet.",89,55,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3228","France","Light, crisp, lemon-scented, with fresh apricots, pear juice and toast flavors.

"3229","France","Ripe, open, apricot and pineapple fruit flavors suffuse this open, generous wine.

Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",87,21,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3230","Spain","With its light leafy aromas and spice notes, this wine takes you back to another era in Rioja. It offers traditional flavors of tomato, nectarine peel and raspberry on a dry, juicy palate. Nothing special but perfectly good for fans of classic everyday Rioja wines. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",87,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3231","Argentina","Bold but also steady across the bouquet, with coconut, chocolate, mint and wild berry aromas. Forward and concentrated in the mouth, where ripe, generous black fruit flavors blend comfortably with chocolate and spice notes. Finishes with drive, mouthfeel and sly clove and nutmeg flavors.",90,30,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3232","France","Slow to show its quality, with a little aeration this becomes a superripe wine, its wood element dominated by the intense tropical fruits. There is some balancing restraint in the citrus character, along with the acidity. Enjoy now.",90,54,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3233","Spain","Dense and roasted on the nose, with tobacco, leather, mild herbal notes and blackberry fruit.

"3235","Australia","Shows a welcome amount of complexity in this price range, with cherry fruit framed by hints of cedar, mint and tobacco. This medium-bodied red leans toward an elegant style, defined by silky tannins and a mouthwatering finish.",87,13,"New South Wales","Merlot",-31.2532183,146.921099,3
"3236","Chile","Hard oak and chemical scents crowd out the limited fruit aromas in this Pinot Noir that feels wiry and high in acid. Flavors of plum and currant are modest, while the finish is low on flavor and high on tang and juicy acidity.",84,19,"Leyda Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,3
"3237","Chile","Like German or Alsace Rieslings, this Chilean version hints at petrol but falls short, thus the nose is wayward and perfumed. In the mouth, this is peachy in feel, with sweet but uncommitted flavors of nectarine and apricot. A chunky finish comes up short on acidity and structure.",84,30,"Casablanca Valley","Riesling",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"3238","Chile","Perfumed and floral on the nose, but also spicy and slightly foresty, which is apropos for Syrah.

Finishes with toasty notes of pepper, brown sugar and woodspice.",89,20,"Colchagua Valley","Syrah",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3239","Argentina","More clean and relaxed than Chalten's 2006 Gran Reserva, this reserve-level Malbec shows generous red-fruit aromas in front of standard but totally pleasant blackberry, spice and chocolate flavors. Nicely balanced, with firm acidity, mellow but present tannins, and a medium-long, slightly oaky finish. Classic Argentine Malbec from Neuquén in Patagonia.",88,15,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"3240","Chile","Santa Ema seems to be striving for the ripest possible style they can get, and along the way they have found that while also losing some elegance. It starts with sweet, jammy aromas that are not far from melted red licorice. The palate is saturated with berry flavors, while the feel is thick but slightly flat. Could use more edge and compexity, but on the plus side it's lush and pleasant.",88,19,"Cachapoal Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3

"3242","France","A big, superripe wine that manages to combine this opulence with an edge of crisp acidity, keeping it well in balance.

"3246","Argentina","Sweet on the bouquet, with aromas of coffee, mocha, berry jam and cherry extract. Broad and saturated on the palate, with ripe blackberry, cassis and chocolaty flavors. Finishes smooth and easy, with ripe tannins. Very nice but ordinary as full-bodied, extracted Malbecs go.",89,29,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"3249","Australia","Leeuwin Estate's reputation for Chardonnay is based on their Art Series, but the Prelude Vineyards bottling can offer decent value. Less so for the 2006, which seems tight and citrusy, lacking the bold opulence that marks the best Leeuwin Chardonnays. It's a solid wine, imbued with pleasant tree-fruit flavors and balanced acids, finishing crisp.",86,35,"Western Australia","Chardonnay",-27.6728168,121.6283098,2
"3250","Chile","Aromas of nettle, bell pepper and lime are slightly gritty and harsh.

"3252","France","A big, round, generous wine with strawberry flavors that are ripe as well as soft. It is very approachable, its dense character coming from delicious fruits that pile layer upon layer on top of each other. It's hard to find the acidity in all this plumpness, but it is there, and creates a fresh finish.",88,60,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3253","France","This wine represents a round, soft style of Crozes-Hermitage and is for immediate pleasure. Rich black cherry fruit is accented by subtle wood spice and anise notes chime in on the almost lush finish. Drink now–2012.",88,25,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"3254","Argentina","Tiza is a very good Malbec with ripe, minty, lush aromas that lead straight to juicy black plum and blackberry flavors. It's intense and powerful, but shows good balance, generosity and proper but strong oak. Expect plenty of kick, power and darkness from this wine. Drink throughout 2009 and into 2010.",88,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3255","France","Big and burly, here is power from Pinot Noir. The tannins are firm, spiced with dark black fruits, rolling luxuriously around the mouth. A spike of acidity gives the wine some freshness, but it remains a big, plump wine.",88,60,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3256","France","One of the most famous Crozes-Hermitage bottlings, the 2005 Domaine de Thalabert is a little tough and unyielding right now, but shows promise in its persistent, peppery finish. It starts off with gamy, leathery notes and hickory smoke, all backed by crisp blackberry fruit and ample tannin. Try after 2012.",88,43,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"3257","France","The smokiness that is apparent in many Chanson wines from this vintage is the dominant character in the bouquet of this big, burly wine. It has richness, a solid structure and some good, dense tannins. At the same time, the acidity reminds us of the freshness of the richest Pinot Noir.",88,73,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3258","Spain","Apparently the allure of Rioja proved too great for the Torres family, because now they have a wine from Spain's signature region. Ibéricos is dark and fruity, with exotic perfume notes and also some soupy qualities.

"3265","Australia","Restraint is one of the buzzwords in Australian wine, which might be one reason that for all of this winery's cult status in Australia, it remains relatively unknown in America.

It's well made and well balanced, but lacks sizzle.",89,125,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"3266","Australia","This rather chunky example of Tasmanian Pinot Noir isn't typical of the genre, but impresses for its bold black-cherry fruit.

"3271","Chile","A friendly wine with aromatic hints of cassis, coconut and chocolate. This wine reflects its northern locale with popping raspberry and plum flavors.

The flavor profile brings candied cherry/berry fruit and an herbal touch, and the finish is juicy and feels right. Standard but more than respectable at this price point.",86,10,"Rapel Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"3285","France","Part of a range of young wines produced by Mas del Perié. This is bright and fruity, relying on black berry fruits, soft tannins and a vivid juicy character. The dusty tannins supply a light amount of structure.",86,19,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"3286","Spain","Dark to the eye, with bacon, ham, spice and savory fruit aromas. The palate is extracted and grating in feel, with dark berry, herb, pepper, smoke and barrel resin flavors. Spicy on the finish, with a blast of clove and cardamom. Very good but not as filled out as in prior years.",89,29,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3287","Spain","Superclean and inviting on the nose, with lemon, melon, apple and stony aromas. The palate has a round, pleasant, chiseled feel and flavors of green fruits including kiwi, honeydew melon and apple. Turns a bit sweet on the finish, but not sugary. Really nice for $15 Spanish Chardonnay.",89,15,"Northern Spain","Chardonnay",43.2691164,-4.2500792,2
"3288","Italy","This is a vinous-smelling wine that recalls the sweet berry aromas you would naturally find in the wine cellar. It's a young wine that still needs to find its legs and that, at this point, delivers overt tones of toasted oak.",85,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"3292","France","The most accessible of Paul Jaboulet Aîné's Crozes cuvées, the 2005 Les Jalets offers smoky, herbal, peppery aromatics, crisp pomegranate fruit and silky   tannins on the finish. It's a solid introduction to Crozes-Hermitage in an early-maturing style.",87,23,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"3293","France","There's a new Jaboulet in town. Actually, this is the same family that put Paul Jaboulet Aîné on the map, but they've sold that company off and have started small again. The 2005 Crozes-Hermitage is a medium-bodied, juicy, fruity wine powered by plums and blackberries. There's ample concentration and persistence, it just needs more complexity.",87,28,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"3294","Argentina","Meaty, herbal and foresty on the nose, all of which are typical aromas for this Salta-bred Malbec. Linear in the mouth and acidic as it tastes exotic due to herbal notes and eucalyptus. On the other hand it's full of blackberry and chocolaty richness. Crisp and nicely built on the finish.",88,25,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"3295","France","A severe wine, its structure deriving from an important wood element and fruit tannins. It brings out apple and green plum skins, with a tangy texture that demands a few months aging.",88,56,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

"3297","Argentina","Opaque and thick, with all types of black fruit aromas blending with smoked meat scents and toasty darkness. The body is fleshy and extracted, with raw tannins and a clacky feel.

"3298","France","Full in the mouth, this is a rich, wood-lifted wine, the peach and apricot fruits given an edge by a light steeliness. The acidity fits well into the rich flavors here, creating a burst of apple juice over the yellow fruits. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",87,15,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3299","Spain","There's no shortage of power here. Forward berry aromas mixed with earth and leather ring true, while the palate is layered, broad, chewy and offers bright cherry and plum flavors.

"3300","Spain","A bit rubbery and smoky on the nose, with some hardness. Airing reveals raspberry and vanilla aromas, while the palate carries some jolt due to sizable acids. Tastes like a burst of red plum and pie cherry, while the finish is tannic, long and full of leftover red fruit. More than respectable for La Mancha Syrah. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",87,23,"Central Spain","Syrah",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3301","Australia","Slightly musky and briny on the nose, with a broad underlay of peach. This medium-bodied Riesling seems lightly honeyed and a little soft relative to its peer group.

A bit oaky and resiny on the finish, but perfectly drinkable as inexpensive Cabernet goes.",86,13,"Maule Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"3303","New Zealand","Offers what folks have begun to identify as pretty standard Marlborough Sauvignon, combining a struck-flint character upfront with grassy notes, melon and fig fruit and followed by a citrusy finish. Seems a touch soft; drink now.",86,19,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3304","Australia","Shows some rather riper-than-expected fruit flavors, hinting at peach or nectarine as well as the standard apple and lime. The result seems a touch off-dry, although the actual residual sugar is only 3.5 g/L. Despite being lightweight in the mouth, it turns a bit honeyed and weightier on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",86,20,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"3306","Australia","Tumbarumba is an up-and-coming cool-climate viticulture region, and this Chardonnay is a fine example of why the area is considered to have promise.

"3308","France","This wine's smooth texture is soft, velvety, needing tannins to give it a sense of shape. As it tastes in the mouth now, it shows pleasant sweet berry flavors and a dense mouthfeel. In the end, it is an easy-drinking, early maturing wine.",85,12,"Bordeaux","Merlot",44.837789,-0.57918,4
"3309","Spain","Licorice and other sweet, dark, unusual aromas set this Syrah on its way. Flavors of raisin and fig tell you that it's ripe, but the mouthfeel is controlled by sharp, wayward acidity. Finishes with additional licorice and cooked caramel flavors, and as a whole it lacks some balance and a game plan.",85,32,"Central Spain","Syrah",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3310","Spain","Fairly obvious vanilla and dill aromas work with red-fruit and resin scents to give this a “roble” sort of nose, meaning the oak is definitely there. (Roble is the word for oak in Spanish.) In the mouth, cherry, plum and pasty lactic flavors integrate the more you swirl, while the finish is toasty and dark, with another wave of oak.",85,15,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"3312","Chile","Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately.",87,12,"Casablanca-Curicó Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"3313","France","Big, powerful wine, full of both tannins and fruit. Being a 2008, the structure is firm and up-front, with the fruit and acidity lying behind. It will need to age for 2–3 years and more to come into balance.",88,58,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3314","France","Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme. Round and warm, it is not typical Chablis, much more akin to a Meursault.",88,42,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3315","Argentina","Tropical aromas blend nicely with honey, peach and fresh-cut hay notes. The palate is focused and properly acidic, with lemon, green apple, vanilla and toasty flavors.

"3316","France","Pale in color, this wine goes for shades of flavor. The initial tannins merge into softer raspberry flavors that in turn become fresh red currants and final acidity. Ready to drink now.",87,25,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3317","Chile","By no means sophisticated or complex, but if you want a ripe, lush, creamy wine with a ton of sweetness, black fruit and good balance, 120 Syrah makes the grade. The palate is smooth and lactic, with creamy blackberry, brown sugar and soft tannins. Rich and pure as they come for under $10.",86,8,"Central Valley","Syrah",-36,-72,3
"3318","Chile","An opening of dried leaves, spice and berry fruit is pretty good and authentic, while the palate feel seems right given the wine's price and structure. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and plum are roasted and mildly herbal but come with proper feel and follow through. Good for under $10.",86,9,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"3319","Chile","Rooty and sweet smelling, much like a root beer soda mixed with smoked meats and spice.

Good for everyday consumption.",86,10,"Curicó Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"3320","Australia","A medium-bodied Chardonnay, Nepenthe's 2009 Unoaked Chardonnay shows the strengths and weaknesses of avoiding oak. Without any sweet caramel or vanilla flavors, it should work well with food. On the other hand, its apple and citrus flavors lack complexity and display a certain angularity on the palate. Drink now.",86,16,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"3321","Australia","Straightforward apple and lime aromatics bust from the glass alongside some slightly smoky, struck-flint notes, but this wine offers rather simple fruit flavors on the palate, It's medium bodied, with a hint of honey already creeping in on the finish, suggesting early consumption is warranted.",86,18,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"3322","Spain","A true but basic Rioja with chewing gum and dark fruits to the nose. It's the acid that grabs you hardest as it hits the palate, while the flavors run toward cherry, sour plum and a nip of cassis. Solid but short on the finish, with pepper and tang.",84,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3323","Spain","Edgy cherry and raspberry aromas carry a bit of rhubarby sharpness, while the palate is bright, clangy and simple. This is a fresh, no-fuss wine that pulls no punches. It's raw and slightly brambly, with decent integrity and no tricks up its sleeve.",84,8,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1

"3325","Chile","A little sharpness on the nose tilts things toward red fruit and rhubarb, yet the palate is more deep and dark, albeit slightly tough.

"3327","Argentina","Always a good buy and always big and husky, Gascón is a saturated and dark wine but one with good balance and texture.

Quite good for a fat young Malbec.",87,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3328","Argentina","Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors.

"3333","Chile","Light and airy, with red fruit and tea aromas. The palate is fairly acidic but not harsh or sour; flavors of pie cherry are balanced and sweetened by caramel, yet the finish is lean and quick, with citrus peel and zest. More of a lighter-bodied refresher with just a spot of oak.",86,13,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3

"3338","Spain","Starts out kind of raw and cutting, with oak, soy and spiky black fruit aromas.

Drink now.",88,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3339","Argentina","With an opaque purple tint and super-concentrated aromas of blackberry and violet petals, this is an in-your-face Malbec that pulls no punches.

"3340","Chile","Quiet on the nose and 100% inoffensive. The palate hints at bell pepper and green bean while also dealing ample pineapple and citrus. Turns a little tart and lean on the back end, but that frames the wine's freshness, zest and energy.

"3341","Chile","Banana, lemon-lime and even some lychee give this a fruity, slightly sweet bouquet. The mouth is solid, while flavors of lemon, melon and lychee are driving but candied.

"3342","France","Well structured, strongly laced with wood, this is a full-in-the-mouth red, very berry and cherry. Its ripe fruit opens gently to give a concentrated finish. Age for another year, but very drinkable now.",88,33,"Loire Valley","Pinot Noir",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"3343","Argentina","Opens with prickly, slightly stemmy aromas.

"3346","Chile","Quite raisiny, with an overweight personality conveyed through the nose. The palate is tannic, with black cherry and cola flavors thickened up by a full dose of raisin.

"3347","Spain","We suggest very little time with this bulky, medicinal Tempranillo. Despite color and weight, it's prickly, sour and not too ripe. The flavors and finish are short, while the overriding impression is that it's underdeveloped.",82,11,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3348","Spain","An aggressive wine with very little charm or character to back up its edgy verve. The nose is skunky while the palate tastes of pickled red cabbage and sharp berry flavors. A weak product reflective of a cool, nongiving vintage.",80,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"3352","Argentina","Slightly sharp and salinic smelling at first, but soon it veers toward strawberry and raspberry, with hints of smoke and rusticity. Still, for the most part this is a basic New World Cabernet with familiar cherry and plum flavors backed by a touch of chocolate. Feels creamy and medium-bodied, with healthy tannins and acids. A nice everyday Cab that doesn't overstep its limitations.",86,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"3354","Argentina","Candied black cherry aromas give this a sweet, rich outlook. The palate is bold and heavy, with ripe cassis and other heavy fruit flavors. It's a big, extracted wine that could use more balance and structure. To this taster, it seems denser and duller than past vintages. Frankly it's syrupy and chocolaty on the back palate and finish.",86,25,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3355","Chile","Earthy and leafy up front, with tobacco and olive aromas in addition to berry and cherry. Full and showing a fierce grip on the palate due to rough tannins.

"3363","Australia","Looking for a medium-bodied Chardonnay with a citrusy edge? Look no further. Peach and lime scents ease into tropical fruit while retaining that zestiness on the finish. Drink now.",85,10,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"3364","New Zealand","Costco's private-label Sauvignon Blanc is priced right and offers a fruity mouthful of melon and gooseberry flavor. The citrusy finish is a bit short, but pleasant.",85,7,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3365","Chile","Plump, sweet and tropical on the nose, but also not that focused or powerful. The palate is flat in feel and a bit sticky, with vague, candied flavors of papaya and melon. There's even an Animal Cracker quality to the finish. Good but not great.",85,17,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"3366","France","Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty. The fruit is on a tight rein of acidity, which only slowly opens up to show mango, pineapple, crisp citrus, layers of toast and a mouth-enveloping richness. Age for at least five years, preferably 10.",97,574,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3367","France","This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now.",95,310,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3368","France","This is from a sub-division of the Corton vineyard, at the northern end of the Grand Cru. It shows both depth of flavor and freshness, a ripe wine that brings in delicious, appetizing acidity and spicy toast. It will obviously age, the nuts and secondary flavors still waiting to show, but as a fruitier style it will be ready in a year.",94,235,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3369","France","Big, powerful brush strokes of ripe fruits, spice and rich creaminess paint this wine with vividness. The fruit envelops the mouth, the pears, green plums and ripe apples working with a citrus edge. Impressive, and with a great finishing freshness.",94,80,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3370","France","A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.",94,117,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3371","Spain","Saucy and a touch baked, with savory lead aromas that render the fruit secondary. Zesty in the mouth, with juicy, prickly acids that propel red fruit, tomato, olive and herbal flavors. Finishes lively and alert, with oregano and dried raspberry flavors. Drink now through 2017.",88,24,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3372","Chile","Fresh and chiseled on the bouquet, with lettuce leaf, green-fruit aromas and white pepper.

An honest SB that won't steer you wrong.",88,11,"Lolol Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.7284166,-71.6458243,3
"3373","New Zealand","A ripe, lush style of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, this features ample nectarine and cassis fruit, tinged with just a bit of green leafiness. Ample weight on the mouth gives way to a long, mouthwatering finish. Winemaker Jules Taylor is on a roll.",92,17,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3374","New Zealand","The Pioneer Block series from Saint Clair remains a reference point for Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. This year, I had a slight preference for Block 3 from the low-lying Dillons Point subregion.

"3375","Argentina","Quite dark and crusty on the nose, with aromas of road tar and obvious oak. Tough but real on the palate, with big tannins and lip-smacking berry and cherry flavors. Shows more oak character and resin than necessary, and thus the fruit flavors don't fully stack up to such heavy wood. Still, it gets it right more than wrong.",86,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3376","Argentina","A heavy, blocky wine with a dark color and aromas that lean toward raisin and reduced balsamic vinegar. The palate is quite full and slightly syrupy in feel, while the flavors are of boysenberry and dark, toasty oak. Finishes with even more crusty, espresso-like wood flavors, leaving displaced wood as the lasting impression.",85,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3377","France","It's hard to like this wine. That doesn't mean it is faulty, it means it seems cold, a very hard-edged style of Pinot Noir. It has the Nuits-St-Georges structure in bucketfuls. The acidity also makes its presence felt, giving a sharp burst on the finish.",85,55,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3378","Argentina","Full, solid and dishing pretty aromas of blackberry, dark plum and mild spice. Sturdy in the mouth, with nice balance and above-average mouthfeel. Tastes ripe, lightly toasted and it finishes smooth if a bit short. Textbook value Malbec; easy to like.",87,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"3381","Australia","Already developed, with hints of toast and marmalade on the nose and showing baked apple and citrus flavors on the palate.

"3382","Chile","A bit narrow and medicinal, but overall this Cab delivers reasonably good cherry and herbal berry aromas and flavors along with some oak, coconut, citric acid and earth. It's a touch muddled and all over the map, but for $10 it's a pretty good wine.",85,10,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3383","New Zealand","Understated grapefruit and herbal aromas lead the way, framing peach and melon flavors. Round and soft on the palate, then turning a bit chalky on the finish. Drink now.",85,14,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3384","New Zealand","A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",85,19,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3385","Chile","Admittedly the early aromas are gaseous and rubbery, but the mouthfeel is fine and the flavors of cassis, fresh tomato and cocoa powder are about as good as any reasonable person could expect for $6. A competent wine that's above average for the price.",85,6,"Curicó Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"3386","France","Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache.

To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2–3 years.",94,99,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3387","Chile","The price for one of Chile's flagship wines keeps climbing, but fortunately so does the quality. Winemaker Enrique Tirado has crafted yet another pounding, saturated Cabernet. It's wonderfully meshed yet potent and fierce. Boysenberry, cassis and kirsch flavors control the extracted palate, while the finish is warm, creamy and fun, sort of like a milkshake. At 14.5%, Melchor is at its max. Hold until 2010 and then drink through 2015.",94,80,"Puente Alto","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.6186082,-70.5906057,3
"3388","France","The Château Grenouilles vineyard, wholly owned by members of the La Chablisienne cooperative, is in the upper part of Grenouilles Grand Cru. As such, this is major Chablis, a wine that needs maybe 10 years' aging. But already, you can discern the richness of this wine, its powerful yellow fruits, honey and toast, dense in texture as well as vivid with acidity.",94,99,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3389","France","This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.",93,115,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3390","New Zealand","Felton Road's Pinots have been among the best in NZ, but the 2007s step things up another notch. The Block 3 combines a briary, slightly herbal element with black cherry aromas, then unfolds on the palate to reveal layers of fruit, coffee and spice. It's lush yet structured, with a long, textured finish. Drink now–2015.",93,75,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"3391","France","This is one of Olivier Leflaive's benchmark wines, showing how his winemaker Franck Grux keeps lightness, freshness and complexity all in play. To start, it is firm and austere, then it bursts out with green fruits, toast, white currants and lemon, integrated and balanced. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.",93,90,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3392","France","This wine from a parcel in the Fourchaume vineyard is a step up from the Fourchaume premier cru wine. That's because it has an extra edge of minerality, of apple skins and tight, ageworthy green fruits. With its final burst of acidity, this will certainly mature over the next 3–4 years.",93,55,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

A ripe, fresh, familiar wine done right.",88,12,"Curicó and Leyda Valleys","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.9779853,-71.2528803,3
"3394","Chile","Crusty on the nose, like a grilled burger or charred steak. There are also herbal aromas that don't present themselves as green. The feel is healthy, while flavors of blackberry, herbs, carob and coffee suggest ripeness and oak. Finishes toasty and fairly smooth.",87,13,"Maule Valley","Syrah",-36,-72,3
"3395","Australia","Light, fresh and silky—just what might be expected from cool-climate Pinot Noir. A pleasant earthiness underscores prettily interwoven strands of herbs and cherries.

"3396","New Zealand","Hand-picked, whole-cluster pressed, barrel-fermented—this represents one of the directions forward-thinking NZ Sauvignon Blanc producers are pursuing. It's fully ripe and velvety in texture, with toasty, nutty notes but no obvious vanilla overtones, as only used oak is employed.

"3397","Argentina","Plump and fruity on the nose, but it also smells entirely familiar and generic. Like most Argentine Cabernets, this wine is tight, tannic and full of cassis and other berry fruits. What it's not is elegant, complex or different than the masses. If you like bold but basic berry flavors, tannic bite and chocolate on the finish, this is for you.",85,21,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3398","France","A fresh, very strawberry and plum skin flavored Pinot Noir from Irancy, a small area near Auxerre and close to Chablis. The wine has some weight because of the vintage, which gives ripeness and an edge of rusticity. It's certainly more than just a curiosity.",85,20,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3399","Argentina","Standard plum and berry aromas provide a nice opening to this dark, solid Malbec that's a little zingy and racy at its core.

"3400","France","A wine that seems to take the softness of Chambolle-Musigny too far. It has sweetness and flavors of raspberry juice, leaving no room for structure or acidity. Drink now, because this wine is too open to last.",85,75,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4

"3408","Chile","Opens with heavy aromas of earth, compost and baked fruit. The palate has a corresponding heaviness and sweet, roasted, buttery black-fruit flavors.

"3410","Argentina","From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.",93,100,"Other","Pinot Noir",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

There is also power here, and a definite ability to age.",93,78,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3412","Austria","Probably Salomon's star wine, this rich, concentrated Riesling brings together ripe white fruits, evocative honeysuckle perfume and a luxurious, creamy texture.

"3417","New Zealand","From one of the Nelson region's pioneering winemakers, this is as good a wine as I can remember the Seifried family producing.

There is wood certainly, but the spice integrates well with the green fruits and the intense minerality. The great steely backbone on this wine indicates it will age.",92,78,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

"3435","Argentina","This starts out massive and grapy, but with each passing minute it becomes more Salta, and hence more complex. Feral, leathery, roasted-berry aromas require patience. In the mouth, this is tannic and muscular, with herbal, spicy, dry flavors of blackberry and stewed plum. Raging acidity and firm tannins suggest that this needs at least until 2016 to settle.",91,30,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

"3437","Argentina","An interesting wine that walks to the beat of its own drum. Organic wines are almost always a little unusual, and this is no different. It pours on the funky red-fruit aromas and then come herbal cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. As a whole it's a good, well-made wine with decent feel. But hailing from La Rioja, it also has its own unfamiliar identity. Worth a try if organic wines are your thing.",84,10,"Other","Cabernet Sauvignon",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"3438","Chile","Hickory and other resiny aromas dominate the nose, and oak is the major player from start to finish. If you like a thick Chardonnay weighted down with cinnamon, resin and extract, then this is it. But to us it's overoaked and borderline cloying. It just doesn't have that natural fresh-fruit touch; seems overmanipulated. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",84,15,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"3439","Argentina","There's more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young, everyday Malbec, and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep. As might be expected given the aromas, the palate is limited to herbal, lightly pickled red fruit, while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate. Decent wine, but that's as far as it goes.",84,14,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3440","Chile","This is a crisp, spicy, fully oaked Pinot with raspberry, herb and toast aromas. Racy and zesty on the palate, and full of zingy, red-tilting pie cherry, plum and raspberry flavors. Turns oakier and toastier late, with caramel balanced by residual acidity on the finish.",87,16,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"3441","Italy","This vintage-dated expression of Chardonnay offers creamy aromas of peach and honey followed by dried sage, toasted almond and crushed mineral. Pair this luminous sparkling wine with rolled salmon canapés.",87,20,"Lombardy","Chardonnay",45.4790671,9.8452433,2
"3442","Italy","There's a fine, pristine quality to this sparkling wine that underlines its age and overall elegance. It delivers aromas of candied fruit, honey, butterscotch and caramel.",87,40,"Lombardy","Chardonnay",45.4790671,9.8452433,2
"3443","Spain","Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit. Flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate are as baked and sweet as the nose, and the feel is grabby and leaves a sugary residue on the finish. Wants to be a modern, ripe wine but proves to be simple and overdone. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",84,22,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3444","New Zealand","From a veteran Marlborough producer, this is an interesting mix of sweetness, tartness and herbaceousness. A honeyed note doesn't quite mesh with the leafy, herbal overtones, while crisp acids come on strong on the finish.",84,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3445","Chile","Not disappointing given the price. There's some toast and tropical fruit on the nose, and then pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity runs a bit sharp, but overall this is a reasonable, warm-climate, tropical Chard for the money.",84,9,"Colchagua Valley","Chardonnay",-34.6761419,-71.097317,2
"3446","Argentina","Generous, sizable aromas of cassis, blackberry and violet are inviting. This is juicy, with slightly wiry acidity creating a racy mouthfeel. Flavors of berry and cassis are loamy on their own but ride comfortably on a wave of tartaric acidity, while the finish is lifted and lively, with black-fruit flavors.",91,27,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3447","France","A tight, vivid wine that expresses pure Chardonnay with a steely eye. The wine is flinty, the green fruits and apple skin texture dominant. There is some wood, but the lightest touch. The finish shows some crisp, lemony acidity.",92,78,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3448","France","Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood. Instead, the delicious yellow and white stone fruits come through, with a creamy edge reminiscent of buttered English muffins, finishing on a high note of juicy, thirst-quenching acidity.",92,115,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3449","France","This is one of the most popular Chablis premier crus, and this soft wine shows why. It hints at minerality, but the main flavors are a great burst of apple and citrus. It has just the right vivid green character, the vanilla from the wood a very subtle afterthought.",92,55,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

"3451","Spain","Slightly roasted on the nose, with aromas of blackberry and a penetrating grassy note. The palate is authentic for RDD, with clipped, herbal flavors accenting soupy berry and bouillon. Finishes earthy, meaning there are leafy notes and dryness.",87,50,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3452","Argentina","Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",83,29,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3453","Argentina","Las Moras is from Argentina's La Rioja region, and Black Label aims to be its top product. But mostly the wine pushes minty, dark oak on top of superficial plum and berry fruit. It's extremely wooded, so the finish deals mint chip and raw wood flavors. A racy and sheer mouthfeel doesn't exactly help it along.",83,18,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

Finishes lightly herbal and easy.",86,11,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3

"3458","Spain","Stretched on the nose, with reedy, wiry, candied red-fruit aromas. Quite tannic and a bit syrupy in the mouth, with ultrasweet berry flavors and then a scratchy, forward finish. Has its merits but seems out of place and pushy for Spain. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",84,14,"Central Spain","Cabernet Sauvignon",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3459","France","While there is definitely some intensity of bitter cherry fruit, there is also a stalky edge to this wine that comes from tart, dry tannins. The finishing acidity gives some freshness, but this remains on the edge of green. Screwcap. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",84,27,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3460","Spain","Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",84,12,"Central Spain","Cabernet Sauvignon",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3461","Australia","This is jammy and almost bubble gum-like upfront, with candied cherry flavors and very little tannic structure. Still, the fruit is bold, balanced by crisp acids, and the wine would pair fine with pizza or burgers.",84,12,"Australia Other","Cabernet Sauvignon",-25.274398,133.775136,3

"3463","Australia","A disappointing effort from this stalwart Clare Valley producer, but still a good wine, with pretty aromas of crushed stone, mint and lime. The mint becomes more medicinal on the palate, veering toward camphor or menthol, while retaining a citrusy edge and decent length.",84,17,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"3467","New Zealand","Built a little more sturdily than some NZ Pinots, Rockburn's 2007 shows fine intensity and purity of black cherry flavors, allied to hints of mushroom, earth and cola.

This is a wine that is still young, still smoothing out its hard edges.",91,47,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3470","Spain","Meaty, rubbery aromas of berry fruits come with hints of minty green and lemony oak.

"3471","New Zealand","A French-owned outpost in the South Pacific, Clos Henri seems to be finally coming of age. This entry-level offering delivers a hint of smoky, fumé character, but also plenty of ripe fruit, ranging from fig, melon and stone fruit to zestier notes of passion fruit.

"3474","Argentina","Sort of gaseous and touchy on the nose, with bramble and sweaty leather rising up once the bouquet opens.

"3476","Argentina","The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",80,18,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3477","Chile","Smells good and fruity, with ample berry force at the bouquet's center along with herbs and spice.

"3480","Chile","Roasted smelling, with black olive, rubber and turned earth on the nose. Syrupy and dense, with jammy flavors of blackberry but not much spice, length or complexity. Finishes quick, with grabby tannins and jammy density.",86,15,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"3482","France","While there is plenty of berry fruit and spice here, there is an awkward petrol character that also shows itself in the shoe polish aromas. If this can blow off, then this is a wine with potential richness. Since it is only just bottled, time will tell. But be cautious. Two bottles tasted. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",84,53,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3483","Chile","Dry, earthy and leafy, with herbal red-fruit aromas. The palate has a lean scratchiness to it along with snappy, drying, roasted berry flavors.

"3487","France","Big, ripe, generous, this wine is on the rich side of the 2006 vintage. At this stage, it offers peach and apricot, with honeyed yeast flavors. The minerality crispens the texture, while black pepper and firm tannins suggest aging ability.",91,67,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3488","France","A rounded, creamy style of wine but with a deliciously fresh green fruit and citrus character. It shows very pure, direct flavors, a line that goes right through the wine. There is only a hint of spice or toast at the mouthwateringly fresh finish.",91,78,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3489","France","White fruits, figs, pears and currants dominate this fine, steely wine, a blend from a number of premier cru vineyards.

"3491","New Zealand","Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs.

"3492","Argentina","This oaky, creamy Malbec is one of Karim Mussi Saffie's trilogy of 2011 La Consulta single-vineyard varietals, and they are so similar in aromas, body weight, flavors and high oak levels that they are virtually interchangeable. Like its bretheren, this pours on the wood, vanilla, graphite, pencil eraser and resin along with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Maybe with time in the bottle it'll gain more individuality.",90,35,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"3503","Spain","Aromas of berry fruits, coconut and leather add up well, but the wine falls off in the mouth, where it's sweet, gummy and jacked up.

"3507","Chile","Dark, dense and very modern in style, with captivating aromas and obvious richness. At 14.5%, this is big, New World Pinot Noir. But its flavors of black cherry, raspberry and cola nut are elevated and brush up against world class.

Finishes with anise and licorice, and just enough acidity to keep it balanced.",86,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3519","Chile","Pushy barrel aromas make the wine smell like toast on top of applesauce and baking spice. The palate shows modest acidity and some flatness, while the flavors run toward apple, mango and resiny oak. The finish continues to be oaky, showing a tropical flavor and sweetness.",85,16,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"3520","France","Full bodied and rich, this has flavors of spice, red plum and caramel. It's quite heavy and dense, so drink it with food.",84,12,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"3521","Spain","Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",83,6,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3522","France","Big, ripe and surprisingly fat for 2006 Chablis, this wine goes for the yellow fruits as well as minerality. It offers full flavors, an up-front fruitiness tempered by a creamy backdrop. Age for 1–2 years.",90,43,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3523","New Zealand","Winemaker Matt Dicey has teased out Pinot Noir's silky texture and ample complexity in this wine, one of his finest to date. Cherry fruit hints at rose petals and picks up subtle earth and spice shadings on the palate, finishing with elegance and class. Drink now–2012, although its balance may permit it to hold for several more years after that.",90,38,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3

"3525","Chile","Few $20 Cabs from anywhere are going to deliver like Medalla Real does. From first impressions, which include aromas of toast, coffee, prune and devilish berry, you know it's a good one. The feel is generous and the balance spot on, so the plum, berry, coffee and chocolate flavors have structure and support. A complete wine with length, mint and lavish tannins.",90,20,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3526","Italy","This pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon from sunny Tuscany has done a good job of holding up to the heat of the vintage. The wine shows ripe aromas of blackberry, chocolate and spice but does not taste jammy or cooked. In fact, it strikes a very good balance between fruit and firmness.",90,35,"Tuscany","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"3528","New Zealand","The new project of Erica and Kim Crawford (yes, the Kim Crawford), Loveblock is situated on a spectacular windswept promontory overlooking the sea. Passion fruit, vibrant and pure, marks the nose, while the plump palate reveals hints of gooseberry that linger through the extended finish.",90,24,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3529","Argentina","Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance.",90,24,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3530","Argentina","Minerally and firm on the nose, it bursts with blackberry and plum aromas. In the mouth, this is lively and medium bodied, while nice acidity allows it to roll over the palate while showing earthy flavors of black fruits and rubber. A saucy, leathery, meaty-tasting finish is friendly in feel.",90,22,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"3533","Australia","Plantagenet's 2008 Chardonnay is an ambitiously worked effort filled with toasty, nutty notes and hints of vanilla, sweet corn and tropical fruit. Drink this medium-bodied yet round wine over the next year or two.",86,20,"Western Australia","Chardonnay",-27.6728168,121.6283098,2
"3534","Chile","Light and generally clean smelling, with standard green apple, melon and lime aromas. Feels a touch flat and pithy for Casablanca, with generic citrus and mild bitterness for flavors. Pithy and just juicy enough on the finish.",86,12,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"3535","France","Epineuil is a small area close to Chablis. This red wine is as light and fresh as its northerly location would suggest. Red cherry juice dominates an attractively textured wine that could be served slightly chilled.",86,19,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3536","Argentina","A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas. Feels closed, tannic and clipped, with narrow berry flavors and green notes. Toasty on the finish, but also clacky feeling. Good relative to other wines, but not at $70.",85,70,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3537","Chile","The oily popcorn aromas are not a turn-off, but they do hint at the resiny, sticky palate. Flavors of honeyed white fruits, oak resin, vanilla and toast lead to a short finish with a sugar-like sweetness. Good, but confected and a touch mealy.",84,12,"Central Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"3538","Spain","Standard berry along with warm, earthy aromas give it some size, and the palate shows medium-bodied raspberry and strawberry flavors. There's a forward, semiracy feel to it, but in the end there isn't a whole lot of finish, flavor or finesse.",83,12,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3539","Spain","Same score as the prior vintage, and pretty much the same tart wine. It's red in color, sweet and candied on the nose, and awkward in general. And then it's citric and sour in the mouth, with flavors of pink grapefruit. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",82,14,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3540","Spain","Starts with pine, saline and berry candy aromas and it settles on sweet and jumpy. Juicy as can be and very lively, but also short, choppy, sweet and with a bubble gum character.",82,6,"Central Spain","Cabernet Sauvignon",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3541","Chile","Smells like an ocean breeze mixed with field greens, citrus and passion fruit. Montes has been a leader in Chile's movement toward coastal SB, and this one is blasting with grapefruit, green apple, passion fruit and minerality. In the mouth, it has some weight and richness; but that's balanced by zippy acidity. Can't imagine a better match for ceviche or tuna tartare.",90,16,"Leyda Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,3
"3542","France","Ripe tropical fruits, peach and pear flavors mingle well in this rich, toasty wine. To balance, there is citrus freshness, but the ripe flavors dominate. An immediately delicious wine that could be drunk now.",90,36,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3543","Argentina","Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors. Pick one or pick them all; they are quasi interchangeable and only time will tell if they show individuality or remain identical triplets.",90,35,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3544","New Zealand","This is on the full-bodied side, quite ripe and tropical in style compared to its Marlborough siblings. Mango, pineapple and stone-fruit notes are all present, balanced on the finish by citrus and ginger.",90,17,"Martinborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3
"3545","New Zealand","This medium-bodied wine shows a remarkable evolution on the palate, where it accelerates through tight, reined-in notions of gun flint and vague leafiness to pinwheels of pink grapefruit and tomato leaf by the long finish.",90,18,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"3547","Chile","Brandied black cherry aromas come with firepower, while the palate is dark and full, with good fruit and some burn. Flavors are dark and sweet, with peppery spice. Finishes equally dark, with blackberry and coffee. Familiar and good for a value-priced Cab.",86,10,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3548","Spain","Smells baked and a little sweet, and also a touch raisiny. The palate is fresher and more jumpy due to lively acidity, while the flavors run toward stewed tomato and plum, with herbs on the back end. Solid, composed and spicy on the finish, with dill and tomato.",86,15,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3549","Chile","A touch green and vegetal on the nose, with hints of canned peas and bell pepper. Fortunately there's enough lime and minerality to keep it fresh. Feels crisp, tight and wet, with green notes pervading core citrus flavors. Finishes pithy and zesty, with mild bitterness.",85,9,"Maule Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"3550","Argentina","Sweet aromas of sugar cookie come with a pinch of citrus fruit. The mouth is plump, with just enough citric acidity to keep it together. Flavors of pineapple, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit peel lead to a pithy, slightly bitter finish. Drink immediately; it's starting to fade.",85,10,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"3552","Chile","Dusty, citrusy aromas form the greeting, while the palate is juicy in style, without much definition beyond zestiness. The flavors offer notes of papaya and nectarine. The finish sizzles for a moment, then fizzles.",84,9,"Cachapoal Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3
"3553","Chile","The nose is a bit prickly and jumpy, with a candied red-fruit aroma. On the palate, there's some grab and stickiness along with flavors of mint, woo-driven spice and berry fruit. It loses some character on the finish.",84,8,"Colchagua Valley","Merlot",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3554","Spain","Thin and saline on the nose, with a chemical-chlorine smell. The palate is fairly sour and raw, with tough tannins and a killer grip. As a whole, the mid-level flavors don't taste like much, and the finish is clamp-down tight.",81,24,"Catalonia","Cabernet Sauvignon",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"3555","Spain","Has some serious cleanliness issues on the nose, and while it's not entirely unpalatable, it does struggle to make many positive statements. Tastes flat, mealy and bitter, and there's even some burn to it. Imported by Scoperta Importing Co. Inc.",80,10,"Central Spain","Sauvignon Blanc",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3556","Austria","With its light touch and fresh acidity over the delicate honey flavors, this is an immediately delicious dessert wine that doesn't dominate by knock-out richness, but by its finesse. Acidity goes hand in hand with the ripe pineapple and peach flavors. Worth aging, maybe 4–5 years. Glass stopper.",90,35,"Kremstal","Riesling",47.9271368,14.080665,3
"3557","France","A complex name for this finely crafted wine. It shows green fruits and oak, some intensity of flavor and a great layer of acidity, cutting through the rich fruits. The finish brings all this acidity forward, giving a classic Chablis minerality.",90,108,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3558","Argentina","An elegant, floral Pinot Noir from Patagonia's top producer of PN. Barda is warm, creamy and intense. An emphasis on balanced raspberry and cherry flavors mixed with rose hip and freshness gives it an Old World personality. A very drinkable and honest style of red wine. Good now into 2011.",90,24,"Other","Pinot Noir",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"3559","Spain","This tiny production (250 cases), single-vineyard wine is boisterous on the nose, with pushy aromas of violet petal, earthy berry, cleaning solution and citrusy oak. Pronounced acidity and a raw, resiny oak texture give a hard, choppy feel, while flavors of cheese, coconut, vanilla and raspberry announce a warm-vintage wine. On the finish, excess acidity and abrasive tannins call for additional cellaring; best from 2015 onward.",90,85,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3560","France","Here's a rich and decadent Pinot with loads of muddled red berry notes mixed with assertive vanilla and sweet cigar tobacco spice.

"3561","Chile","Solid on the nose even if it's stretched thin with leather and cheese notes. The palate is fresh, zesty and scratchy, with tart red fruit flavors and limited density and richness. Turns lightly green and minty the more you get to know it.",86,14,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3562","France","Yes, there are some tannins and a chunky texture. But this wine is more simple Pinot Noir than structured Nuits-St-Georges. Its acidity and sweet blackberry fruits offer an attractive combination of freshness and jamminess. Not for aging.",85,50,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"3563","Chile","Mossy, furry, leafy black fruit aromas are a reasonably good opening. Feels upright and alert, with bright acidity.

"3564","Chile","Grassy and a little horsey on the nose, with a controlled herbal/weedy character. Chunky, round and full in the mouth, with mild acidity and oaky, muddled red-berry flavors and vanilla. Plump and short on definition. Good, however, for the money.",85,11,"Maule Valley","Pinot Noir",-36,-72,3
"3565","Argentina","Neutral smelling except for a bit of lime, grass and mineral. Feels juicy and citric in the mouth, with pithy flavors of lime, orange and green grass. Finishes slightly bitter and pithy, but fresh and tangy.",85,12,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3566","Argentina","Grassy red berry and plum aromas lead to a lean, somewhat high-acid palate with herbal, oaky flavors of raspberry and plum that don't last that long. Fresh and healthy feeling on the finish, but tasting more of oak and spice than fruit.",85,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3567","Chile","Dark in color, this wine has an oaky and earthy nose, with a compost streak. It feels full and stocky, and it tastes of resiny oak and dry berry fruits. It finishes with a citrus-like juiciness.",83,10,"Curicó Valley","Pinot Noir",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"3568","Chile","A leafy compost aroma shows plum and berry scents. The palate has a fresh but choppy feel, with pasty berry and resiny flavors. Short, minty and herbal on the sticky-feeling finish.",83,10,"Maule Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"3569","Chile","Melony and green on the nose, with an asparagus note. The palate sports enough acidity to keep it afloat, but the flavors shift quickly from lime and melon to peas and asparagus.",83,15,"Leyda Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,3
"3570","Spain","Herbal, green and grassy, with less than fresh fruit character. The palate has a weedy taste, while the finish is green and peppery. Edgy mouthfeel; barely acceptable red wine for the second straight vintage.",80,9,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3571","New Zealand","This is pungent stuff—redolent of sweaty socks and nettles—but it's also concentrated and intense, balancing out those strident aromas with round, ample flavors of melon and green tomato. It's leafy, fresh and assertive on the finish. Drink now.",89,17,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3572","New Zealand","Passion fruit and nectarine aromas are joined by hints of jalapeno, while the palate displays stone fruit flavors with tropical overtones and grassy accents.

"3573","France","Beautifully rich for such a lowly appellation in the Burgundy hierarchy. It is soft, open, dense, with ripeness and balancing acidity as well as flavors of pineapple and citrus pointing up the richness, just touched by wood.",89,56,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3574","France","Spice, especially nutmeg, is a distinctive character in this soft, ripe wine. It lacks some definition, but is attractively round. Fruit flavors tend toward white pears, edged with toast, while the texture is fat, full.",89,90,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3575","New Zealand","Saint Clair's main Sauvignon Blanc bottling came out really well in 2013, balancing green leafy notes with grapefruit elements. It's not as big or bold as some of the Pioneer Block wines, but instead boasts a sense of firmness and a fine line of chalk and acid from start to finish.",90,18,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3576","New Zealand","A well-crafted effort, this is on the fuller side of the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, balancing ripe stone fruit and guava notes with hints of struck flint, potent acids and a long,  mouthwatering finish.",89,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"3578","Australia","Featuring tobacco, cassis and lesser quantities of mint and cocoa, d'Arenberg's The High Trellis Cabernet is a full-bodied wine that offers plenty of flavor interest and depth at a reasonable price.

"3600","Chile","Lots of big fruit is what defines this easy-to-like wine. The nose throws off equal parts cassis, raspberry and plum, while the palate is saturated and dense, with pleasing cassis, plum and chocolate flavors. Given that the price is under $15 and production was 150,000 cases, it's hard to register any complaints. This is your classic Best Buy Cab all the way around.",89,14,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3601","New Zealand","Admirable for its consistency from year to year, the B is always a safe choice. It adds a layer of creamy texture to bold passion fruit aromas and ripe citrusy flavors. Best consumed before the end of 2014.",89,25,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"3604","Australia","De Bortoli's unique approach to harvest timing and extensive use of new oak leaves this wine seeming rather disjointed: coffee and cola notes dominate the tart, cranberryish fruit flavors. I suspect it will show better with a few years' of cellaring, but until then, I remain unconvinced.",84,60,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3

"3606","Spain","Spicy wood notes and black fruit vie for center stage on the ripe, semimature bouquet. This is more of a traditional Ribera wine, meaning it has textured tannins, notes of tobacco and dill, and leathery, earthy berry fruit flavors. Not at all rough and ready to drink now, but still it should hold into 2009.",88,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

The final flavors are of spice, vanilla mixed with crisp acidity.",92,59,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"3609","Italy","This is a delicate and traditional Chianti Rufina Riserva with enticing notes of mature black fruit, exotic spice, molasses and resin.

Pair it with red meat and game dishes.",89,19,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3610","France","A soft, rich and ripe wine, showing some light wood character and delicious forward pears and yellow plums, plus a crisp line of acidity that gives the wine a vivid lift and extra freshness. There is some minerality, but that is much less dominant than the fruit. Screwcap.",89,44,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"3611","Italy","A small percentage of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is added to this Sangiovese-based wine to add structure and softness.

"3618","Australia","This is slightly darker and more roasted in character than the 2006 version, with a caramelized note to the dried apricot and honey flavors. It hints at bergamot rather than lime, but retains the long, mouthwatering finish of the 2006.",88,19,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"3619","Spain","Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer. Feelwise, this is a tough, angular wine that will benefit from another year or two of aging.

"3620","Spain","Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers.

"3622","Spain","Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",83,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3623","Chile","Very dark and chunky, but also loud and aggressive. This is simply a big, purple wine with mid-level ripeness and only modest depth of flavor. It's grabby and tannic, and if that's all you're after it's serviceable.",82,13,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3624","Chile","Pinot Noir from Chile is still a new entity, and this one doesn't do much to further the cause. It's lemony and lacking in pure fruit, with a flat mouthfeel and a weedy bite to the finish.",81,11,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"3625","New Zealand","This is an extraordinarily lush and tropical Chardonnay, yet one that manages to achieve this without excessive alcohol or weight.

"3626","Chile","Crusty but also perfumed on the bouquet, and then quite snappy and a little edgy in the mouth.

"3630","Argentina","Heavy oak greets you on the nose in the form of shoe polish and blackened aromas. This feels ripe, solid and woody, with good structure.

"3631","Spain","Aromas of cured meat, earthy plum and dry berry fruits are composed and harmonious. This mature wine feels firm and a touch grating, while ripe flavors of blackberry and plum are borderline baked.

"3636","Australia","This is incredibly dark, concentrated stuff from what may be the oldest (planted in 1886) continuously producing Cabernet vineyard in the world. Minty, herbal notes combine with chocolate and cassis to yield a complex, balanced whole. Despite the density of the fruit, there's absolutely no sense of heaviness or excessive weight, and while the tannins appear creamy on the midpalate, they fan out into a silky sheen on the lingering finish.

"3645","Argentina","A well-made Malbec that should please almost any fan of red wine. The nose is concentrated and full of black fruit, so it delivers what you'd expect.

"3647","Argentina","For a tough, cool vintage, this wine displays lush qualities and depth, bordering on jamminess.

"3680","New Zealand","The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.",88,19,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3681","New Zealand","There are 100,000 cases of this bargain Sauvignon Blanc for the U.S. market, so it should be pretty easy to find.

Drink now.",88,13,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"3682","Spain","This dry, floral, exotic Rioja is a different breed of cat. The bouquet is jammy and herbal, with flowery notes.

"3684","Italy","You can taste the touch of consulting enologist Carlo Ferrini here: This is an opulent, modern and plush rendition of Chianti Classico with deep tones of cherry, vanilla and chocolate fudge. It's rich and plush in the mouth with velvety tannins and dark concentration.",92,50,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3685","Italy","This is a lovely Riserva with thick and penetrating tones of cherry, spice and cola—the holy trinity of traditional Chianti Classico. The wine is dense, concentrated and intense without being too powerful or overwhelming. It would make an excellent companion to veal in a wine reduction sauce because of the natural succulence and structure.",92,27,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3686","Chile","Pithy and peachy on the nose, and not nearly as zesty smelling as it is in the mouth, where angular, crisp acids push flavors of citrus and passionfruit. Zesty with a ton of kick, and very much in the Leyda mold of being oceanic and full of passionfruit. Mature but not fading; drink before summer 2011.",89,20,"Leyda Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,3

"3688","Chile","Solid, juicy Cabernet that has a lot of fresh berry and black cherry on the nose. The mouth is forward and fruity, with slick plum, berry and cherry flavors.

"3699","Italy","The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose.

"3702","Australia","Behind some mint, eucalyptus and cedar aromas, this is a big, meaty Cabernet, with lots of flesh and power. The tight cassis fruit needs some time to unfold and the mouthdrying tannins need some time to resolve, but all the ingredients for future excellence are in place. Drink 2012–2020.

"3708","Chile","Lively and a touch prickly, with strong aromas and flavors that properly reflect its Leyda roots.

"3711","New Zealand","The aromas are mildly toasty, but also vibrant with yellow plums, while the flavors are rich and almost sweet-tasting, ranging from caramel to melted butter to exceedingly ripe peaches.

"3712","Italy","Obviously shaped by a hot vintage, this Riserva delivers bold notes of black cherry, plum, dried prunes, old leather and exotic spice.

"3724","Spain","A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive. The nose has wild flower and melon aromas, while the palate shows simple apricot, pineapple and mango flavors.

"3725","Spain","Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh.

Imported by Bernard Magrez.",91,75,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3728","Chile","A touch heavy and medicinal on the nose, but it isn't reduced or dull, and with airing it settles into a nice place. It's mildly herbal, which is typical for Chile.

"3738","Argentina","Extremely ripe and concentrated but arguably a bit too massive for its own good. That said, we love the wine's tobacco, cassis and inky qualities, but worry a little about the lemony oak character and overall potency.

The palate is juicy, but that only helps propel the apple, green banana and nut-driven flavors in the wine. Slightly creamy on the finish.",89,25,"Bío Bío Valley","Chardonnay",-36.9777206,-72.331113,2
"3756","France","Made from old vines in a single vineyard, very intense even in its youth. It has a smooth, creamy texture over a core of flint and herbaceousness. It gradually builds, offering green and white fruits and vibrant acidity. This is a beautiful wine.",91,23,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"3757","Italy","Meaty black fruit, cherry, blueberry and plum set the stage for what is a youthful and fruit-driven Sicilian red. The wine has an informal personality that would pair well with hamburgers or pasta.",87,10,"Sicily & Sardinia","Syrah",37.5999938,14.0153557,3
"3758","Chile","This is a nice, round, waxy sort of Chardonnay. The nose offers integrated oak, bath oil and ripe tropical fruit aromas. The palate rests mostly on citrus, i.e. mellow orange and tangerine. Thus it's not overly zesty or citric; rather it blends in vanilla and a spot of oak to lend character and a modicum of class. Drink now.",87,14,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"3759","Italy","Here is a very attractive Chianti Classico from Banfi (of Brunello di Montalcino fame) with a rich bouquet of cherry, wild berry and exotic spice. It is a delicate wine with background shadings of Spanish cedar and root beer that linger on the finish.",87,16,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3760","Italy","Here's a 2004 Chianti Classico (with a 15% component of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon for extra structure and smoothness) that delivers aromas of wet earth, white mushroom, blackberry, tobacco and leather. Drink it with stewed meats or game dishes.",87,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"3762","New Zealand","This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",88,16,"Hawke's Bay","Sauvignon Blanc",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"3763","Spain","Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",86,9,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3764","Spain","Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",84,11,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1

"3766","Spain","For an old-school highlight, look for this lesser known selection-based Reserva, because good grapes from a good year should add up to good wine. And in this case, the wine is better than good; it's ripe, spicy, chocolaty and pushes all the right buttons. A sure thing with the right foods: meats, stews, etc.",91,55,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3767","Spain","This wine reflects the great vintage and CVNE's long-standing status as a quality Rioja winery; the final product zips along with lively blackberry and plum flavors before slowing into a smooth, mellow and lengthy finish. A blue chip wine with style and finesse.",91,30,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3768","Spain","This is not a blow-you-away RDD, but it is a smooth, well-composed red wine with clean, alluring aromas and ripe-styled fruit flavors that touch on raisin but then pull back to black cherry and dark plum. With its integrated tannins and mild finish, this is ready to go now and should hold form for about five years, maybe eight.",90,30,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3769","Italy","Dark in color with thick concentration, this “family” Riserva offers loads of spice lavished over fresh cherry, red fruit and plum.

"3770","New Zealand","Steve Bird, who put Thornbury on the map before selling that brand to Villa Maria's owner, is back with a fairly rich, amply endowed Sauvignon Blanc.

"3771","Chile","Put this on the scale and watch it tip. It's a monster of a Cab that's quite tannic and therefore narrow on the palate. But if given time in a good cellar it may soften into something much more evolved than it is now. Early openers should expect black fruit in spades, with nail-like tannins. Best to have a steak on the grill if you are drinking this any time soon.",89,25,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3772","Chile","Lo Mejor is the most elevated, worldly Pinot in the Corpora group's portfolio (Veranda, Porta and Agustinos are others). It is ripe and smoky, with alluring berry aromas and smooth black cherry and raspberry flavors. It's warm and a bit fiery on the finish, but with food that won't be a big factor. A good example of what Bío Bío can do with Pinot Noir.",89,20,"Bío Bío Valley","Pinot Noir",-36.9777206,-72.331113,3
"3773","New Zealand","This is a big, broad-shouldered Sauvignon Blanc, slightly oily in texture, with pungent scents of crushed tomato leaf and plenty of gooseberry fruit. The high alcohol, moderate acidity and richly concentrated fruit give the impression of sweetness on the long finish.",89,30,"Wairau Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.565373,173.5286352,3
"3774","Chile","Basic but in the best possible way. The nose is familiar, clean and inviting due to licorice, sweet black fruit and smoky aromas. Fresh in the mouth, with bright acidity pumping up berry, cassis and herbal flavors. Composed on the finish, with a high level of competence.",88,12,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"3775","Australia","A full-bodied Cab, with bold cassis flavors tinged with vanilla. There's no hint of green in this ripe, rich wine and no hard edges, either. Long on the finish—a top Cab for a reasonable price.",91,30,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"3778","New Zealand","At only 8.5% alcohol, this is on the racy, lean side, although there's sufficient residual sigar to balance the crisp acids.

"3782","Australia","Marlargo's wide range of wines includes this big-boned, rather chewy offering from Heathcote.

"3784","Chile","Recent vintages from TerraNoble have taken on a very roasted, demanding sort of personality. This Cabernet is toasted to the max, with burnt, crusty aromas. In the mouth, it's much fruitier than you might expect but narrow, with firm tannins giving bite to the cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Riles up the palate and even tastes a bit herbal (10% Carmenère may be the culprit).",87,15,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3785","Argentina","Floral aromas and berry power up front, then lead to a fresh, bright, almost screechy feeling palate. Toasty berry fruit flavors are moderately spicy and the finish offers a reprise of toastiness and kick.

"3786","Spain","Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour. The palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus, but there's also some banana to contemplate. In the end, it's just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two, which isn't a great testimonial.",84,30,"Northern Spain","Sauvignon Blanc",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3787","Spain","An oaky, awkward, lactic lug that offers a ton of wood grain, funky fruit and a hard, overly spicy mouthfeel. It's trying to do too much with smoke and mirrors; the raw material isn't there.",83,47,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3788","Australia","From a reliable Clare Valley producer, Pikes 2006 Dry Riesling appears to be an ageworthy effort, boasting plenty of crisp intensity.

"3789","Italy","Thick, almost impenetrable concentration sets the tone and is followed by dense, plush and youthful aromas of blueberry, cherries, sweet spice and almond paste. The wine has obviously experienced a sophisticated wood aging regimen and this has helped to shape its chewy consistency and firm tannins.

"3790","Italy","Cherries, blueberries and sweet Christmas spice characterize this Riserva and help fill out its dense, dark extraction.

"3791","Italy","This 100% Sangiovese Morellino delivers great intensity, ripe red fruit, raspberry, licorice and dried herbs. It is a real charmer thanks to vibrant fruity flavors and a solid, firm built. Aged 13 months in barrique, it would pair well with roasted meats or lamb stew.",90,25,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"3805","Spain","A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused.

Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",85,23,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3806","Italy","The wine opens with a saturated, ruby color and segues to aromas of plump cherry, thick spice, tobacco, leather and pretty balsam notes.

"3807","Australia","Minerally and intense on the nose, this Riesling remains fresh and strident right through the palate and onto the long finish.

"3816","Argentina","With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs.

"3839","Chile","A little angular on the nose, but there's no question about its identity. This wine smells and tastes like true Pinot Noir; it's ripe and has nice flow, with flavors of red plum, spiced black cherry and peppercorn. Is it Burgundy, Oregon or anything like that?

"3853","Australia","Smells like trail mix, barbecued over an open fire. On the palate, it's butterscotch central.

Best Buy.",84,6,"Maipo Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"3909","Chile","The nose is oaky and grainy as it offers aromas of corn and wheat as well as some pear fruit. The apple, honeydew and oak flavors make for a robust palate, but one with a sweet, mildly artificial-tasting core. The finish is oaky and resiny, although there's some necessary balancing acidity and citrus flavors to keep it steady.",84,6,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"3910","France","Fine ripe fruit here, with plenty of sweet apple and pear flavors. The wine is ripe, soft, open, maybe lacking concentration but with a great tangy herbaceous character. Screwcap.",88,20,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"3911","Argentina","A nice wine with aromas of lead pencil, violets, black fruit and a sprinkling of lemon zest. The palate has body and a chunky outlook, while the flavors of berry fruits, spice and something slightly exotic work. A solid, approachable wine that should bring a smile to the face of any Malbec lover.",88,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3912","Chile","Fairly earthy and a touch sulfuric at first, but in due time this Pinot rounds out. The body and attitude are full and forward, while the medium-to-full palate shows nice raspberry, dry plum and spice flavors. Ripe and clean for the most part, with some chocolate and mocha on the finish.",87,17,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"3913","Chile","Ripe, round and a little reduced on the nose, this delivers rich fruit, full tannins, and flavors of dark berries, cassis and mocha. The finish of coffee and chocolate is likable, and overall you can dismiss a bit of syrupy heft because the wine has integrity and true Cabernet flavors.",87,19,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"3914","Argentina","Anyone looking for a whole lot of wine for not too much cash will be pleased with this blend, named for former Argentinean president Juan Perón, husband of Evita. Back to the wine: it's rich, heady and borderline opulent, with ripe tannins, plumpness and hedonistic fruit. Incorporates 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah.

"3915","New Zealand","Starts off with a lovely, complex mix of cola, caramel, cherries, vanilla and herbal notes, but seems a bit simpler on the palate, delivering cherry and vanilla flavors.

"3917","Australia","A pretty, talc-mineral note pervades from nose to palate, bolstered by tangy peach and pear fruit. It's a lighter style of Chard, not an explosion of flavors; finishes with a buttery-lactic note. Imported by Epic Wines.",86,17,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2

"3919","Spain","Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty. The   palate offers ample raisin and toffee, while the finish is aptly spicy. Good heft and texture, but short in the midsection.",87,16,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3920","France","Jacquesson is proud possessor of top quality grand cru vineyards in Avize. This vintage is subtle, a wine that takes a while to show all its richness, balanced with elegance. The fruit is ripe pear, peach and orange zest. It has a great streak of minerality. Worth aging.",94,125,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4

"3922","Australia","Wonderfully varietal Cab Sauvignon from a region that can sometimes lose some of the variety's characteristic herbal notes. Mint and dried herbs on the nose give way to classic cassis fruit. It's nicely rounded yet still firm enough in structure, picking up subtle vanilla shadings on the finish. Drink now–2015.",88,23,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"3923","Italy","This is a streamlined Chianti Classico with less heft and concentration on the palate and more light elegance. The nose imparts a sensation of cool harmony thanks to its measured tones of fruit, vanilla and toast. This is a clean, crisp wine with polished tannins and a smooth texture.",88,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"3925","Spain","Smoky and dry, with aromas of tire rubber and mildly herbal, leafy red fruits. The palate has a dry, rugged, scratchy feel while the flavors veer toward baked raspberry, earth notes and coffee. Finishes nicely, with berry fruit at first and then herbal, oaky afternotes.",88,19,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3926","Spain","Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback.",88,70,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"3929","Australia","Offers sun-warmed, fresh golden apple and caramel aromas. Apple flavors come through as well but the texture is odd, like sawdust and mineral. I didn't enjoy this bottling quite as much as E&T;'s unwooded Chardonnay, but those who prefer caramel to fresh fruit and acidity will feel differently. Imported by Scott Street Portfolio.",85,16,"Western Australia","Chardonnay",-27.6728168,121.6283098,2
"3930","New Zealand","This wine was a big award winner back in New Zealand, and it's easy to see why. It's full-bodied and rich but never heavy, with complex aromas and flavors that include cola and coffee, black cherries and plums, cinnamon and clove. Finishes long, with mouthwatering acids and a fine coating of silky tannins. Delicious now, but should last through at least 2012, maybe longer.",92,35,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"3931","Italy","This is a very attractive ruby-colored wine from the Adriatic Coast of Italy that delivers fresh notes of blackberry, cherry, spice, tobacco and leather. The wine is very rich and velvety in the mouth, but remains contained and elegant at the same time.",87,17,"Central Italy","Sangiovese",41.87194,12.56738,3
"3932","Australia","The aromas are just beautiful: Inhale deeply and there's spice, nut, cassis and gumtree notes. Has wooly, textured tannins that grip the midpalate firmly, along with plum and almond paste notes that carry on through the finish. A real pleasure; drink after 2008.

"3934","Argentina","The price on this perennial bargain brand from Valentin Bianchi has crept up in recent years, and thus its value potential has stalled somewhat. But it's still a fruity number that once it opens and settles delivers jammy aromas and solid red-berry flavors. We like that it's neither candied nor weedy. 60,000 cases proves that good wine can be made in quantity.",85,9,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3935","Austria","Usually a better wine than this, the 2005 Knily shows modest quince and sour yellow plum aromas and rather anemic flavors. I had a substantial preference for the Jaunegg's Klassik bottling.",85,26,"Styria","Sauvignon Blanc",47.3593442,14.4699827,3
"3936","Spain","Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",86,55,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"3938","Spain","This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.",86,14,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3939","Australia","Merlot in the Barossa can be a tricky proposition, but this bottling successfully juxtaposes superripe, chocolate fudge notes with surprisingly tart acids. Hints of licorice, vanilla and black cherries impart complexity, while creamy tannins and crisp acids mark the finish. Drink now–2012.",88,48,"South Australia","Merlot",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"3940","Spain","Dense and fairly earthy, with a big coating of chocolate and char courtesy of full-force oak.

Not stellar but showing a lot of qualities.",88,54,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3941","Australia","Mint and cassis aromas and flavors also pick up a slightly pruny or raisiny edge, and this wine does show some alcoholic warmth in the finish, evidence of superripe—maybe even overripe—fruit. It is dark and lush, with supple tannins and a full mouthfeel so on balance it's a very good wine, just be aware that it may be overdone for some tastes.",88,30,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"3942","France","Caramel and toast aromas lead to a wine where wood is, surprisingly for Sancerre, an important element. It has weight, a creamy texture, suggestions of mellow peaches, soft and ripe.",88,29,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"3943","Spain","A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.",88,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3944","Argentina","Sweet and candied on the nose, almost like a jelly doughnut at first. But with airing it turns more savory, herbal and dry. Flavors of tomato, raspberry and herbs are robust and interesting, while the finish is less so as it flattens out and seems baked. Very good but needing a bit more spunk to rate higher.",88,21,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3945","Australia","This is classically styled Australian Cabernet, which is to say it's not overly weighty or rich, opting instead for restraint and archetypal aromas and flavors of tobacco and cedar. It evinces bright and fresh fruit on the finish—a welcome antidote to the otherwise preponderant vanilla and oak-derived spice.",87,60,"Victoria","Cabernet Sauvignon",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3

"3949","Australia","Sorry to steal the moniker from the company's Shiraz, but this is Classic Clare too, offering bold flavors of honey-coated minerals perked up by curls of lime zest.

"3952","Chile","Very smoky and dark on the nose, with hints of charcoal, chocolate and blackberries.

"3956","Italy","Aged in large oak casks, this is a lively wine with obvious but not overwhelming wood flavors on the heels of mature fruit, black cherry, chopped herbs and a subtle medicinal note that adds dimension. The wine is fresh and tonic in the mouth with juicy fruit flavors, nice freshness and good length.",88,30,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"3959","Spain","From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors.

"3960","Australia","Delicate and kind of ethereal at first, but seems to grow a spine the longer it sits in the glass.

Imported by Cumulus Wines Inc.",90,30,"New South Wales","Chardonnay",-31.2532183,146.921099,2
"3961","Italy","A very attractive and seductive Satén sparkler with plush notes of toasted almond, dried apple skin and poached pear.

"3970","Spain","Not a bad little quaffer. From Martinez-Bujanda, this colorful, ripe red is solid and chunky, with sweet aromas of berries and black plum.

"3976","Chile","A bright berry bouquet with light herb and anise notes ushers in a palate of black currants and leather, with mega-doses of oak.

"3980","Chile","Generally speaking we are big fans of Odfjell's wines, but not so much the Syrah. This vintage is a step up from the overdone, overoaked 2005. It has floral, high-toned berry and plum aromas and more than a kiss of vanillin and cream. The palate is tight, a bit lemony and woody, with forward flavors of red fruits, cola and mint. Not all that spicy, varietal or complex, but definitely a healthy, ripe wine.",86,20,"Maule Valley","Syrah",-36,-72,3
"3981","France","The Xavier Flouret range includes wines from both Spain and France.

"3985","Australia","This Sauvignon starts off with a very pretty lemon meringue aroma, which translates on the palate as a dusty-citrus core. There's a helping of fresh green herbs and peas just at palate entry, with white peach and green apple flavors on the midpalate. Round and a shade less zesty than it has been in previous vintages, but still one of the prettier Hills SBs available in the U.S.",89,17,"South Australia","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"3986","Argentina","Robust red wine, with ever-changing aromas of earth, leather, baked fruit and more. Shows glimpses of complexity amid standard, chunky Malbec flavors of plum and blackberry.",84,9,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"3987","Spain","Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope. The nose is mature and woodsy, while the palate is light, acidic and still dancing with plum and cherry. Best if you don't expect too much from it.",85,16,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"3988","Italy","This bargain-priced Chardonnay delivers the goods. Hints of butter on the nose come from 25% barrel fermentation and malolactic, while the fresh pear and ripe apple flavors come straight from the fruit. Clean on the finish.",85,7,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"3989","France","Making a vintage only from Chardonnay, the Gimmonet family is able to bring out the best of the year. This wine retains its crispness, minerality, almost chalky texture and fresh pear flavors. Its freshness promises aging potential.",92,84,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"3990","France","Fresh apples, grapefruit and sweeter apricots all hang together well in this elegant Chardonnay. It's an apéritif style, its crispness giving a light character, the fruit floating over the acidity. There are lively green fruit flavors to finish.",91,65,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"3991","Italy","Unexpected notes of soy sauce and ginger are awkward at first, but fall comfortably within a greater aromatic context of black fruit, plum, cherry, prune and licorice. There's deep berry succulence in the mouth, with oak tones at the back that glide over polished texture and feel.",87,32,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3992","Italy","Despite its youthful appearance, this delivers aged notes of leather, tobacco, granite, black fruit and plum. Mature fruit flavors, backed by zesty spice, are noticeable in the mouth and reinforce chewy, succulent consistency.",87,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3993","Italy","The wood tones are very evident although vibrant fruit notes are not totally masked: You'll encounter cherry, forest berries and a very pleasing blast of menthol freshness. The wine drinks a bit young, with loads of oak nuances thanks to 10 months in tonneaux, and ends on a slightly sour note.",87,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3994","Italy","This really is the quintessential pizza or pasta wine: It offers medium intensity and build, just as Chianti should, and big notes of cherry fruit, tobacco, smoke and leather.",87,16,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"3995","Spain","For a value-priced wine this scores well. The nose offers a nice mix of earth, warmth and berry fruit, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of zesty berry. Composed on the finish, which is also fresh and lively. Perfect for by-the-glass or casual consumption.",87,8,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3996","Argentina","There's a mix of good and questionable here. The nose starts out gaseous and stinky, as if it's begging for air. Give it time and it settles on exotic, warm blueberry and floral aromas. The palate is downright syrupy and thick, with licorice, bitter chocolate and sweet berry flavors. Rich as they come but also soft and on the brink of overripe. Not a wine for the cellar.",87,25,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"3997","Spain","A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",87,11,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"3998","Chile","$11. Opens with a highly perfumed bouquet of lime, anise and a hint of paraffin. Delicate and fresh apple, lime and stone-fruit flavors follow. Off-beat and slightly lean, but has nice balance.",84,11,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"3999","France","Pale salmon pink, this is a light, easy wine. Faint melon and herb aromas lead to an off-dry palate with sour-cherry and anise flavors. Nothing complicated here, but good enough balance to be refreshing.",82,8,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Chardonnay",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"4000","Chile","The soft melon and white-peach nose has mint and grass accents but also a faint mustiness. In the mouth the mild lime and melon flavors display an odd, lemon candy-drop sweetness. This light wine is balanced, but the elements never really come together.",82,14,"Maipo Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4001","Chile","The tart green-apple fruit has a musty note that doesn't yield with time in the glass. The wine is dry, the flavors nondescript and there's not much palate texture",82,9,"Maule Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"4002","Chile","A contrast of sweet and bitter elements shows in the blueberry-jam, vanilla and balsam aromas and the plum, earth, and herb flavors. Firm, puckering tannins frame this light-bodied Merlot.",81,9,"Maule Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"4003","Australia","Made to fit a standard mold, but made well. Aromas are of plum and cinnamon, with similar notes on the palate. Slender in body, with smooth tannins and a nut-laden finish. Imported by Southern Starz, Inc.",89,23,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4004","France","A ripe, strawberry- flavored wine, with richness and dense flavors. It's a great summer rosé, with ripeness coming from sweet fruits and a dry, firm aftertaste. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",89,20,"Alsace","Pinot Noir",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"4005","Australia","Cabernet through and through, with interesting aromas of pepper, bacon and sausage that take on cool menthol notes with air. Wide and juicy on the palate, its purple fruit taking a backseat to the wine's chenille-like texture. Drink 2007–2009. Imported by Boutique International.",89,25,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4006","Chile","Aromas of olive, mineral and tar convey a dark, meaty personality, but in the mouth the wine is basic and approachable. Expect richer than average plum, prune and buttery herb flavors, followed by a chunky, easy-riding finish. Drink now into 2010 and keep your expectations tempered.",86,14,"Aconcagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3
"4007","Italy","There are sharp and slightly nervous notes here of bramble, wild berries, artichoke leaf and crushed white peppercorn. The wine is thin and streamlined with bright berry flavors on the close. Pair it with pasta and meat sauce.",86,14,"Central Italy","Sangiovese",41.87194,12.56738,3
"4008","Chile","Early rubbery aromas give way to purer black-fruit notes. The mouth is generous and shows good feel and structure, while the flavors of blueberry and blackberry are simple to like, modestly sweet and generally quite ripe. Decent length and spice on the finish close it out nicely.",86,11,"Central Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"4009","Chile","Olive and herb aromas carry the bouquet, while the body and mouthfeel are big, bulky, a touch unfocused but definitely not miserly or wanting for power. Tomato and oregano are prominent flavors, and the tannins start to build right from the start. Solid as a block, but herbal like an old-school Chilean Merlot.",85,13,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4010","Italy","There's a pungent note here of overripe fruit or mature strawberry that takes away from the overall harmony and elegance of the wine. Instead, this is a workhorse Merlot with soft, chewy tannins and a thick mouthfeel that could match lamb in spinach curry sauce.",85,8,"Central Italy","Merlot",41.87194,12.56738,3
"4011","Chile","A little funky and sweaty, but definitely a live-wire white with tons of lime, kiwi, citrus and grapefruit flavors. It has good mouthfeel and acidity, and then long, powerful green notes to the finish. Not run-of-the-mill; it's a bit wild and out there.",85,14,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4012","Argentina","A typical New World Chardonnay in that it starts with corny aromas that are matched by heavy toast notes. Act two is an ultra sweet palate that seems more sugary than ideal. Very tropical as well, with sweet mango and pineapple flavors. Too sweet to be convincing as a dry white.",83,19,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4013","Italy","Sangiovese is enhanced with a tiny quota of Canaiolo to produce a traditional-style Chianti Classic with high appeal and drinkability. In measured doses, you'll recognize black currant, mulberries and slate-like mineral flavors over a cool, fresh finish.",87,26,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4014","Italy","Give it a few minutes to open and you will be rewarded with small berry aromas, bramble, forest floor, spice and fresh wood oak tones. The wine's structure is elegant but solid with dusty tannins on the finish.",87,29,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4015","Chile","From the opening whiff, this wine shows an off-putting lean, piney aroma. The apple and pineapple fruit are almost completely veiled by the green oak perfume that most tasters won't get past.",81,13,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"4016","Australia","This is a young Cab, not meant to be drunk for another 3–5 years at least. At this stage, it takes a long time in the glass to reveal its black cherry, eucalyptus and soil flavors; its tealike tannins reign for now. Even, measured and pleasantly full, it just wants more richness and vibrance, which may or may not reveal themselves with time. Imported by Negociants USA, Inc.",89,45,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4017","Argentina","For a lighter-bodied wine, this sure shows a lot of aggressive, resiny oak. The nose has sawmill qualities, while the palate is woody and spicy, with apple in the background. Seemed better in 2004; wasn't nearly as oaky.",83,10,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4018","Argentina","Scattershot aromas of wet paint and berries are the opening salvo. Acid-based red fruit carries the palate, while the mouthfeel is electric to the point of overbearing. Tastes alright but doesn't have the cuddly feel or lushness that's the signature of a good Malbec.",83,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4019","Argentina","Dry and toasty on the nose, but tart, racy and raspy on the palate. The raspberry and cherry flavors are sharp and fall off to dry and lean as the wine progresses.",82,16,"Mendoza Province","Pinot Noir",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4020","France","A soft, relatively ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, moving towards white fruits, even hints of lychee spice. But the wine also has an herbaceous element, showing young, green plum juiciness. It is simple,fresh and attractive to drink now. Screwcap.",85,16,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"4021","New Zealand","From an area just outside Martinborough, this is a rather restrained Sauvignon Blanc, one dominated by melon and white grapefruit. It finishes a little soft, but with a quick herbal burst of flavor.",85,18,"Wairarapa","Sauvignon Blanc",-40.950146,175.662255,3
"4022","Australia","Starts off with aromas of stewed plum and wintergreen, then takes a turn toward leather and chocolate on the palate before ending with a hint of coffee. The end result is a touch heavy and overripe without straying too far off course.",85,17,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4023","Chile","A touch stemmy on the nose along with hints of compost, leather and animal. But in the mouth, it rings true as Pinot Noir. The flavors of spiced cherry and plum skin are light and zesty, but the wine isn't a cipher. And the accents of vanilla and wood on the finish help it along.",85,12,"Maule Valley","Pinot Noir",-36,-72,3
"4024","New Zealand","This shows a slightly smoky or fumé character on the nose, then melon and citrus notes. It's on the lean, zippy side of things, without any overt tropical fruit or herbaceousness yet ending on a lime-like note.",85,16,"Waipara","Sauvignon Blanc",-43.0548342,172.7612505,3
"4025","France","Offers up decent aromas of sour cherries, then folds in leather and earth notes on the palate. This is an easy-to-drink claret for immediate consumption—little tannin, some coffee, tart cherries for balance.",84,10,"Bordeaux","Cabernet Sauvignon",44.837789,-0.57918,4
"4026","Spain","Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents. Chewy and chunky, with flavors of black cherry and raspberry. Yet still tangy and refreshing enough to avoid being clumsy.",84,7,"Levante","Tempranillo",37.8945909,-4.7549218,1
"4027","Italy","Da Vinci delivers attractive ruby brilliance with sweet notes of red berry, leather, spice, espresso and toasted oak. This is approachable on every level and promises to make an excellent match to pasta and meat dishes.",87,16,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4028","Italy","Sangiovese with a small percentage of Canaiolo are blended to produce a vibrant wine with good intensity and distinctive notes of berry fruit, blue flowers, rose petal, graphite and warm wood tones. It is smooth and creamy in the mouth and backed by solid structure.",87,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4029","France","Aromas of clove, strong, spicy oak and sublimated cherry open this hard-to-decipher wine. Large-scaled, with a full mouthfeel, there's no nuance to read, but we caught a faint glimpse of fruit up front and sensed lovely mineral elements below the surface later. Tight now, but time will tell.",90,65,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4030","Australia","Has aromas of vanilla bean, apple, resin and light toast. On the palate, peach is the dominant flavor, coupled with an undercurrent of olive oil and a white-peppery edge. A little soft on the palate, but quite charming nonetheless. Imported by Southland Wines.",88,16,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2
"4031","Argentina","Not a lot of ambience to talk about. The nose is almost peanutty in its murkiness, while the flavors of cherry, burnt toast and green pepper are less than impressive. Not an overly bad wine; it just fails to impress at any juncture.",81,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4032","Argentina","Foresty and damp on the nose, with just a touch of standard red fruit propping things up. Runs leafy and dry in the mouth, with a hard, almost bitter finish. Too tough and tannic to really enjoy.",81,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4033","Argentina","A lot of funk on the nose, and it never really goes away. Aromas of burnt coffee, sulfur and charred meat are less than attractive, while the palate runs weedy. Just too shaky and off to rate better.",81,9,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4034","Argentina","In general, we've been liking Bosca's wines. But this Cabernet is murky and tomatoey, with too much stagnant character to earn a better score. Not really up to par.",81,18,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4035","Argentina","The color and aromas stir intrigue, but the brutally sharp palate that runs on steam-roller acidity does it no favors. Succulent to the point of sour, and giant to the point of overdone, this wine needs to head back to the garage for a tune-up.",80,20,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1
"4036","Italy","This is a powerful, high-alcohol wine with overripe notes of raspberry and black cherry. It's is all about ripe red fruit and there's little spice or toast to back it up. It's an easygoing expression of Sangiovese from Central Italy with enduring sweetness on the close.",85,12,"Central Italy","Sangiovese",41.87194,12.56738,3
"4037","Chile","Seemingly more oily, rich and waxy than the 2007, with woody elements and sweet but bland cantaloupe-driven flavors. There's a light essence of citrus, but overall it's plump, melony and at or already past its prime. Drink immediately.",85,14,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"4038","Chile","A little soft and syrupy on the nose, with vanilla and blackberry aromas. The palate is full but clumsy, with jammy berry flavors and not a whole lot of precision or focus. Fleshy late, and always a bit wayward. Good enough if not put to the test, but among so many Chilean Cabernets it doesn't distinguish itself.",85,12,"Maule Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"4039","Italy","Smoky and heavy, with a charred nose that masks strawberry and mineral notes. A bit shrill, but at least the cherry and raspberry fruit pops on the palate. Finishes warm and long, with a blast of fresh tomato.",84,10,"Central Italy","Sangiovese",41.87194,12.56738,3
"4040","Spain","This co-op wine is almost a good deal, but ultimately it does not show enough depth or elegance to reach the next level. The nose is a touch stewy and lifeless, while the palate offers chewy raisin, plum and berry. Flat on the finish, with a syrupy feel.",83,15,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4041","Italy","The nose is very fruity and ripe with intense notes of forest berry, cherry and blueberry that play a leading role next to spice and church incense. From an estate founded in 1994 by Nadia Betti and Renato Spanu near San Gimignano, Tuscany's “City of Towers,” this is a simple, genuine red that would pair well with informal meals.",87,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4042","Italy","Has mature notes of red fruit, exotic spice, blueberry comfiture and thick balsam notes and offers refreshing red fruit tones in the mouth and a very fine, dusty quality of tannin.",87,23,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4043","Spain","Round and fruity, with sweet, attractive aromas. The palate is a bit dark for cava, with plum and bitter chocolate flavors. The feel is soft and foamy, with a dry, roasted note on the finish. Clear as can be; easy to tell that it's Pinot Noir. Imported by CIV/USA.",88,12,"Catalonia","Pinot Noir",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"4044","Argentina","The color is a rich gold hue, while the nose offers a collection of apple, cinnamon, mineral and toast. This is a full-bodied and well-made wine, with baked-fruit flavors offset by spice and white pepper. Then it finishes creamy and sweet, highlighting toffee, caramel and vanilla. With proper weight and acids, it's balanced. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",88,23,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4045","France","Saint Cosme assembles this wine from seven different parcels and gives it a relatively short (2 week) maceration. The result is a wine of exceptional complexity and finesse, starting with delicate herb and violet aromas. Red plum and stone fruit flavors take hold of the midpalate, yet there's always an intriguing spice note in the background. Rich, yet fresh, with great length. Drink now–2015.",93,65,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4046","Italy","There's a flat or slightly oxidized quality to this wine: It opens with a deep golden color and offers aromas of mature peach, apricot, ash, almond paste and lemon zest. In the mouth, the wine is creamy and rich and has a spicy close that recalls crushed white peppercorn.",84,15,"Central Italy","Sauvignon Blanc",41.87194,12.56738,3
"4047","Chile","A sweeter, richer, more confected wine, with aromas of buttered toast, butterscotch and apricots. The body is full but not what you'd call flabby; there's adequate acidity to cut the chunkiness. Flavors of apple, melon and mango are sweet, and there's some toast and then a mealy quality to the finish. Heavy and sugary but not a bad wine if you get at it now, before it fades to corny flatness.",84,14,"Aconcagua Valley","Chardonnay",-32.653179,-70.0108675,2
"4048","Italy","The style here is light and lean with subtle but distinct aromas of berry fruit, blue flowers, exotic spice and cedar wood. In the mouth, this is a medium-bodied wine with fine, tight texture and noticeable freshness on the finish.",86,24,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4049","Australia","There's an earthy, dark-humus character that comes through in many of the Ross Estate wines, and this Cabernet shows it as well, blending that with hints of green herbs, chocolate and cassis. It's a bit coarse in texture at this young age; give it another year or two to settle down, then drink it over the next five to six.",86,27,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"4051","France","Very toasty and closed, it was hard now to get beyond this wine's wood veneer. Faint honey and earth flavors accompany a rich mouthfeel, but this wears an almost impenetrable oak shell.",88,55,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4052","France","Seemingly at its peak of maturity, although it should stay there for several years, this is a masterful Saint-Joseph, showing great complexity (flowers, pepper, smoke, cherries), ripe fruit and satin-textured tannins. Drink now-2012.",92,95,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4053","Australia","From the folks who bring you Two Hands comes this big Cab, which sticks to the glass and deals a chile-spiced nose right out of the gate. The front palate is loaded with chocolate, mocha and forward fruit—all of the hedonistic sexiness your palate can handle. A hint of sour cherry is buried, suggesting that some of its assets may reveal themselves down the track.",91,105,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4054","Chile","Full and fiery smelling, with black cherry, cola and oaky aromas of butter and cream. The flavors are a touch herbal and creamy, while the fruit leans toward berry and fat plum. With airing it settles into a simple, reasonably good Merlot.",84,17,"Maule Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"4055","Chile","Not what you'd call overtly fruity with its charred, reduced set of grilled meat and leathery aromas. The palate is more fruit-ladened, with raspberry and plum flavors getting a boost from vanilla and cola accents. Not bad but sort of rubbery and baked in the end.",84,10,"Curicó Valley","Syrah",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3

"4058","France","Made entirely from Pinot Noir from the heartland of Burgundy, this wine has an attractive light-pink color.

Imported by Boisset America.",88,15,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4059","New Zealand","This widely available brand continues to turn out reliable bottlings vintage after vintage.

"4060","New Zealand","Soft, with a lush, friendly texture, this wine's black cherry and cola flavors are pleasant enough, if slightly simple.

"4061","New Zealand","Grassy and herbal—verging on vegetal—but with just enough ripe nectarine flavors to help provide a sense of balance. It's nicely round in the mouth, with a soft, easygoing finish.",86,18,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4062","France","Solid and lean, this wine shows a bouquet of dried fruits and leaves, dark berries and leather.

It finishes with medium length and even, fairly resolved tannins.",87,40,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4063","Chile","Earthy and chocolaty at first, but with air it reveals a more candied, coco-puff set of aromas and flavors. There's sweetnees, sharp acidity, marshmallow notes and snap.

"4064","Argentina","Big and ripe, with chewy fruit and a lot of plum and blackberry character. At 15.3% it hides its alcohol amid berry, cassis and black-pepper flavors.

"4065","Australia","A really interesting, different style of Merlot for Australia. Bramble and black pepper accent berry fruit on the nose, and the palate has focused, taut berries with a claylike mouthfeel. Imported by Southland Wines.",88,15,"Western Australia","Merlot",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3
"4066","Australia","This Chardonnay's vanilla bean and smoky oak aromas are compelling, as are its flavors of citrus peel, white pepper and cream. It's fresh and round on the palate, finishing with a zing of citrus. Imported by Southern Starz, Inc.",88,22,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2
"4067","France","Young and intense on the nose, where dried black-currant aromas pick up hints of chocolate and espresso. This is full-throttle ripe, with lush fruit, great body, soft tannins and good length on the finish. Drinkable now, but should develop more nuance in another 5 years and last at least until 2015.",91,42,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4068","France","Although Chave's négociant bottling labeled Offerus can be a bit underfruited in some years, in the superripe 2003 vintage that's not an issue. It's rich, full and velvety, with blueberry fruit accented by peppery spice, meaty, black olive notes and a touch of espresso. Delicious now, but should have stuffing to last through 2015.",91,23,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4069","France","This contains a fairly high proportion (10–15%) of Viognier, but still seems more tightly packed than Faury's 100% Syrah Saint-Joseph. It's riper, with more cherry-berry fruit and less meatiness, but still has great floral aromas and hints of pepper on the finish. Drink now–2015.",91,47,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4070","Australia","The nose of this Bordeaux-like Cabernet displays strong herb and earth tones. Cassis, earth, dried herb and licorice flavors ride the even, medium-weight palate. The finish is dry, with tart berry and a slight citrus note.",86,13,"New South Wales","Cabernet Sauvignon",-31.2532183,146.921099,3
"4071","France","Offers a bouquet of pear and anise, plus an earthy floral note. Richer flavors of apple and quince follow, with lime and toast accents. Displays a good acid spine and some class, finishing even and dry. This wine has nice parts.",86,18,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4072","France","Here's everyday drinking at an okay price. Lemony and grapefruity aromas and flavors, with very high acid that scours the palate. It's rough around the edges, and the tartness lasts through the finish.",83,7,"Bordeaux","Sauvignon Blanc",44.837789,-0.57918,4
"4073","France","Light in body and flavor, this southern France everyday wine has slight aromas of berries, and drinks thin, tasting mostly of alcohol and acids. There's not much to recommend, beyond affordability.",80,6,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"4074","Spain","Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",86,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4075","Argentina","Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",86,15,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4076","Chile","A bit aggressive and hot at first, and then mossy and earthy. The palate delivers weight and forceful acidity, while the berry flavors are robust but grating and weighed down by a lot of warm, woody overtones. Like a bucking mule; at $28 it seeks to be more than it is.",83,28,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4077","Australia","Hmmm. This shows some attractive savory and spicy elements on the nose, but the fruit is limited to tart berries and the feel on the palate is lean and astringent. Drink up.",83,15,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4078","Chile","Clean, basic green-melon aromas set up a scouring, lean palate that features little more than narrow green apple and citrus flavors. With scour and scallion notes on the finish, there isn't a whole lot of joy or thrill to this rudimentary SB.",82,13,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4079","Argentina","With its vanilla and caramel accents on pure pear and apple fruit, this is a good, basic Argentinean Chard. The palate is clean and forward, with solid apple forming the framework. Shows just enough butter and toast to warm it up, but it's not a heavy wine. Smooth and easy. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",87,12,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4080","Australia","Smells like sand, gravel and Meyer lemon zest. The feel is dry, smooth and crisp, with some unctuousness—pretty different from most Aussie Sauvignons, to be sure. The texture is the salient feature here; if you're one who prefers bright SB fruit character, this wine's dust, citrus pith and hay notes might not satisfy.",87,25,"New South Wales","Sauvignon Blanc",-31.2532183,146.921099,3
"4081","France","This wine seems to have evolved quickly, going from dark and sturdily tannic in June to more perfumed and lighter-bodied in August. I'm happy to report that the changes have been largely for the better, although I have mild concerns about the wine's potential longevity. It now has a bouquet of fresh flowers, herbs and flavors to match. Harmoniously blends amounts of florality, meatiness, spice and fruit. Drink now–2010.",90,22,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4082","France","True to Colombo's style, this is rather oaky, but with a few years of aging the oak has turned cedary, blending easily with iron and cassis. Long on the finish, with strong cinnamon notes. Drink now-2015.",90,80,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4083","Italy","Here is a more affordable wine created by the makers of Italy's legendary Sassicaia that has truly come into its own in 2004. The wine has a playful linearity to it accented by many rich mineral tones such as granite and slate roof. Take a second sniff and you'll get chocolate, leather and toasted nut. Good acidity, succulent tannins and persistence make it a stand out wine.",90,50,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4084","France","Vigneron David Reynaud has only been apart from the co-operative for a couple of years, but this is an impressive effort. On the nose, this wine has it all, from flowers to spice to fruit. Then it backs that complexity up with mouthfilling flavors of tart red berries and finely wrought tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",90,27,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4085","New Zealand","A medium-bodied, softly structured Pinot Noir, with earth and black cherry notes that come across as cola or chocolate. Drink now–2010.  Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",85,16,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4086","Spain","Typical of many 2002 Riojas, this packs a punch but doesn't hit many high marks. The nose is heavy and dark, while the plum and cherry flavors that carry the palate also have touches of green and bramble. Ample oak covers the wine and its weaknesses, and in Roda's skilled hands the wine isn't bad.",85,44,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4087","Italy","Although the general ensemble works, this wine is a bit lean and thorny in places. Aromas include forest floor, white mushroom, wild flower and sour cherry. The mouthfeel is lean but does offer simple fruit flavors.",85,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4088","Italy","After a slow start, this reveals vibrant notes of red fruit, mineral and toasted nut. There's a nice overall roundness that makes it soft in the mouth and an easy, pleasant drinking experience.",85,12,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4089","France","This sleek, elegant wine opens with a crisp bouquet of limes, nuts and toast. Subtle orange and stony mineral flavors sit atop a taut structure, making this archetypal Puligny. Firm acidity and a long, complex mineral finish make this young thoroughbred a champion. Editors' Choice.",93,50,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4090","Australia","Powerful and clean, this Chard opens with pronounced aromas of citrus and peaches, underscored by honey, smoke and butter. The wine is tight and complex, seemingly wrapped in a minerally, iron straightjacket now, but with good aging possibilities; the long finish also supports this hypothesis. High acidity boosts the impression of strength and cleanliness. Editors' Choice.",92,18,"New South Wales","Chardonnay",-31.2532183,146.921099,2
"4091","New Zealand","Rich, textured aromas of raspberry puree, cinnamon, warm cherry tart, smoky vanilla, leather, and mint. In the mouth, stunning fruit and spice, gorgeous balance, perfectly ripe, oak so well integrated, racy, silky tannins, and brilliant acidity, this beauty's got it all. Dusty tannins suggest midterm aging. Super value.",92,15,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4092","Chile","A big-time dud given Torres' track record in Chile. This wine, no matter how you cut it, is flat, vegetal and smells and tastes of corn. There's no pulse and very strange aromas and core flavors. Way out on the fringe as far as Chardonnay is concerned.",81,20,"Curicó Valley","Chardonnay",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,2
"4093","Argentina","Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches. The mouthfeel is fabulous and the finish of Swiss chocolate and integrated spice is as smooth as silk. Drink now through 2011.",96,123,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4094","Chile","A balanced specimen, from front to back and top to bottom. The nose deals smooth fruit touched up by chocolate and a whiff of mint, while the mouth is spicy and herbal but also saturated with dark berry notes and touches of the forest. Stout in terms of feel, with cheek-to-cheek depth.",90,21,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4095","France","Yves Cuilleron's style is not aimed at blockbuster levels of extract. The 2004 L'Amarybelle exemplifies his balanced approach, yielding ample blackberries and spice couched in a medium-weight wine that is very supple, elegant and persistent. Drink now–2012.",90,40,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4096","France","An excellent effort from young Emmanuel Darnaud, offering good richness and texture to go with pepper-laden cherry aromas. It's plump and mouthfilling—especially for a 2004—with silky tannins on the lingering finish. Drink now–2015.",90,25,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4097","New Zealand","Despite this wine's ample weight, it lacks a bit of generosity, instead leaving behind dry, minerally impressions of pencil shavings and citrus fruits.",85,16,"Hawke's Bay","Chardonnay",-39.1089867,176.7416374,2
"4098","Spain","Deep purple in color; this is a classic young grapeball across the bouquet, with sweet candied fruit aromas. The palate is plump and full of youthful blackberry flavors, while the finish is moderately chewy and substantive. Not a finesse-driven wine by any means; but good if you like simple, forward fruit character.",84,7,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"4099","Australia","Opens with a stylized nose that displays cassis, mint, leather and even toasted marshmallow notes. It's unique, and draws you in to the unusual, sweet caramel-spice and dark cherry flavor combination the palate offers. A long finish with good tannic structure closes this harmonious wine. Lots of oak, but it works well here. Editors' Choice.",91,25,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4100","Australia","Perhaps the best Oz Pinot we've tasted, with smoky, meaty aromas that segue seamlessly into sour cherry, chocolate and earth flavors. It's full and soft in the mouth before finishing long, with notes of leather, cedar and cherries.",91,36,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"4101","France","Peach, orange and spice aromas and flavors, a buttery, full mouthfeel and nicely utilized oak all combine to create a harmonious impression.

"4102","Australia","Dense, dark, and young, this beauty is brimming with thrillingly clean, upscale fruit, if you can find it under heavy tannins. It's a well-structured wine with a solid core of blackberry and cassis fruit. Oak is moderate, but noticeable. The overall result is a fancy, very good Cab.",90,24,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4103","New Zealand","Starts with strong, nuanced aromas of spiced green apples, citrus, melon, and fig, and turns explosively fruity in the mouth, with tiers of ripe, spicy juniper berry and lime. Bone dry, it's fruit is highlighted by high acidity.  The finish is remarkably long, rich, and spicy.",90,12,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4104","Italy","Very pale straw in color, this sparkler delivers measured aromas of honeydew, pear and crushed stone. It's a direct and genuine wine that delivers the goods at an attractive price. Tasty and clean in the mouth. Imported by Zonin USA.",87,15,"Piedmont","Chardonnay",45.0522366,7.5153885,2
"4105","France","Moody, complex and brooding, this is a superb wine and an exceptional value. Purple violets, black forest cake, cocoa nibs and espresso granules all abound on the nose, backed by dark juicy black raspberries. Full and firmly structured in the mouth with notes of pepper, tea, smoked meat and black fruit on the palate.",93,28,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Syrah",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"4106","France","Toasty and nutty on the nose, this is a lush, fruit-filled Burgundy that nevertheless retains a sense of minerality amid its baked-apple flavors. It's plump and custardy in texture, with ample power and concentration, turning minerally on the finish.",90,70,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4107","Australia","Smells very pretty, like mineral, lemon meringue and fresh produce. It's elegant and balanced on the palate, with floral, melon and minerally notes working in harmony. Fairly long and persistent on the finish.",90,27,"South Australia","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4108","France","Rich blackberry aromas and flavors are marked by hints of vanilla and toast. It's supple for Cornas, yet still features a chewiness to its tannins that suggest a few years of aging would by helpful. Drink 2009–2015.",90,38,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4109","New Zealand","A bit of a letdown after the 2005, this lean, slightly astringent Pinot Noir offers tart cherry flavors touched with black tea leaves. Finishes on a pomegranate note.",84,19,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4110","Argentina","Inky dark and an outstanding example of high-end Malbec. This is the finest Alta we've tried; it is ripe as can be but not raisiny. The palate is creamy and lush, but with good acidic balance. And the flavors of black fruits, chocolate and spice make it a league-leader. Drink now through 2012.",93,57,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4111","France","A pure Syrah cuvée (not allowed under the appellation contrôlée…it must only be around 99.99% Syrah), this is a supple, ripe Syrah that still retains some peppery spice on the finish. Although the dominant fruit note is blueberry and this wine is a bit Shiraz-like, it's also savory and complex. Drink now–2012.",90,40,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4112","France","Lacks the haunting fragrance of the best Hermitage wines, but shows plenty of concentrated dark fruit and toasty oak. Supple and vanilla-laden at first, it firms up and shows more plum fruit and pepper on the finish.",90,85,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4113","France","The high quality of simple, introductory wines like this cuvée is a great sign for the bigger 2005s yet to come. The aromas are intense without being jammy or overripe, featuring peppery, herbal notes to go along with bold raspberry and cassis fruit. The tannins are supple enough to make this approachable right away. Drink now, and plan to stock up on Robin's 2005 Cuvée Alberic Bouvet when it's released.",89,28,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4114","France","Complex from the start, marrying floral aromas with hints of stemminess, herbs and spice, all supported by lush black-cherry fruit. Picks up notes of black tea on the finish, so while this tastes good now, it may even improve in another year or two.",89,36,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4115","Italy","Although this is fresh and genuine in the mouth, it loses points for a nose that seems tired and redolent of mature fruit. As tradition dictates, the Chianti blend sees smaller percentages of Canaiolo and Colorino to back a Sangiovese base.",84,13,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4116","Spain","Dark and resiny, with aromas of leather, black olive and jammy berries. The palate runs quite sweet and without the backbone needed to prop things up. Hence the mouthfeel is lacking and the finish peters out quickly. Tasty enough, but short on feel and structure.",83,10,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"4117","Spain","Gold in color, with papaya, almond and orange on the nose. The palate features a heavy mix of citrus and apples, and in the end it's a style that leaves you questioning its intention. It's dense and wet, but also reduced and clumsy.",83,10,"Northern Spain","Chardonnay",43.2691164,-4.2500792,2
"4118","Spain","Spice and warm leather on the nose are worthy aromas, but there isn't much fruit and the palate runs gritty and acidic. It's got freshness and fairly good purity; but it's also kind of narrow.",83,10,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"4119","Spain","Opens with peppery, earthy black cherry and berry aromas, yet the palate is clacky and narrow, with high acidity and dry, limited flavors of blackberry and black cherry. Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.",85,18,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4120","Spain","Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",84,17,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4121","Argentina","Fairly brambly and a little sour on the bouquet, with prickly fruit aromas. The palate is just as sharp and angular, without much cushion to fall back on. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are slightly herbal and tart, while the finish is more of the same. Not as round and ripe as you'd expect for an $18 Malbec.",84,18,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4122","Australia","Black ash, cedar and crushed raspberries are the aromas here, while an underlying note of wet earth keeps things grounded. The palate has a sweet cherry cordial character while the short finish offers up a hit of mixed berry soup. Drink up.",84,12,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4123","France","Very good depth and intensity of fruit show in this rich and masculine bottling. A ripe black cherry foundation bears cocoa, herb, earth and tobacco accents, yielding a complex range of aromas and flavors. The finish is taut and quite dry, dressed up with tart cherries and leather. Hold for 2–3 years.",89,42,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4124","Australia","In a style that nods more to Bordeaux than the New World, the cassis, tobacco and herb bouquet shows class and style. Displays fine balance and good acidity, which supports the ripe black-currant fruit, cedar and peppery notes. It's structured rather than plush, and finishes long, dry and toasty. Drinkable now, it should improve further with a few years' aging.",88,30,"Western Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3
"4125","Australia","A wine that combines pretty black-cherry fruit with cinnamon, earth and mushrooms. The fruit is pleasant enough, but the emphasis is on the earthier side of Pinot—soil and mulch and bark; some herbal flavors chime in on the finish. Might improve with mid-term cellaring.",88,22,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"4126","Australia","Out of the chute, the aromas are sweet and cloying, but settle to reveal cured meat and leather notes. Purple fruit on the palate has its share of stably, briary accents, on through the finish. It's not the deepest, broadest wine on the block, but its unusual profile merits it a look, particularly with food. Imported by Indigo Wine Group.",87,15,"Victoria","Cabernet Sauvignon",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"4127","Argentina","Ripe and plummy, with blackberry on the inviting nose. Sizable on the palate, with raspberry and cassis in spades. Wholesome and nice, with no noticeable flaws.

Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",87,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4128","Argentina","Ripe, tight and fresh, this is what everyday Merlot should be like. There's some roast meat and leather atop cherry on the nose, and behind that there's black fruit, leather, bacon and pepper flavors. A totally legitimate table wine for a good price.",87,9,"Mendoza Province","Merlot",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4129","Argentina","Spicy and alluring, with molasses, earth and barbecue on the nose. Bold blackberry, plum and cough syrup work the palate, while the finish is tannic and firm.

"4130","Australia","Always a pleasant sipper, the Jacob's Creek Riesling offers scents of cream and baking bread on a base of key lime.

"4131","France","A full masculine nose of lime and hazelnut opens this solid offering. Restrained orange, peach and toasty oak flavors are displayed elegantly on the full, richly textured palate. Feels mature and ready to drink. Finishes with mineral, peach and oak notes.",88,39,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4132","Australia","Here's one of the bigger Chards of the year. Explodes with aromas of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, and, oh yes, tropical fruits. The flavors are mouth-filling and rich, like a sweet, custardy, creamy, tangerine-flavored dessert, yet it's dry. However, it loses a few points for being too big and aggressive without the necessary balance. It's awkward.",87,17,"New South Wales","Chardonnay",-31.2532183,146.921099,2
"4133","France","The well-defined bright lime and mineral aromas and light peach-pear flavors ride a fine acid backbone. Despite the crispness and mineral notes characteristic of this appellation, the mouthfeel is fairly full. Very approachable, with a clean, fresh finish. Tailor-made for shellfish and salads. Drink now–2003.",87,17,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

"4135","Argentina","A bit of burnt character clouds the grapy nose, but it's not a heavy, overoaked wine.

Imported by Epic Wines.",86,21,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4136","Spain","Peppery raisin is the dominant aroma on this condensed, sun-baked wine that surprisingly shows spiky acidity and a rugged mouthfeel. Seems like the winery was shooting for a riper, bigger style than its regular Vega Esteban crianza, and that heft and kick don't really help.",82,20,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"4137","Spain","Lemon peel and citrus aromas are the proper foreshadowing of what's to come: a tart, lean, old-style wine that is ultimately lean and grabby. These days you have to give the consumer more richness and flavor than this.",81,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4138","Spain","Acceptable, but barely. There's a strange citric, grassy tinge to the nose that makes it smell like Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. And it tastes pickled and briny. Decent mouthfeel and sensory balance save it from even lower depths.",80,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4139","Australia","A bright pear and cinnamon nose opens this attractive, medium-weight wine. The palate shows peach and pear flavors, supported by brisk—some might say sharp—acidity, but flabby it isn't. Shows good balance and a nice long spicy finish, where the oak comes on strong.",86,12,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"4140","France","This introduction to white Burgundy derives from sources in Puligny and Meursault. A bouquet of hay, earth, liqueur and even some green tobacco aromas opens to a palate of ripe pear and mineral flavors. Evenly textured, the wine is round but not fat. Finishes crisp and dry, with decent length. Drink now.",86,15,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4141","Chile","Mildly nutty aromas open to a palate of dry apple and oak flavors. This Chardonnay is a comfortable weight—it's neither too light nor too fat. Closes with good length, and a touch of nuttiness and spicy oak.",86,10,"Colchagua Valley","Chardonnay",-34.6761419,-71.097317,2
"4142","Australia","Not what you expect from an Australian Sauvignon Blanc, the Oxford landing is harvested quite early, resulting in aromas of grass, grapefruit and cat pee rather than tropical fruit. It's bone-crackingly crisp and light on its feet; a cost-effective choice for fans of Sauvignon Blanc.",84,8,"South Australia","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"4144","Argentina","Piercing leather, berry and foresty aromas lead to a zesty palate of medicinal cherry and raspberry flavors.

"4145","Argentina","Peach, melon and apple carry the clean but ordinary bouquet, and behind that comes a round palate full of ripe banana, pear, caramel and vanilla. Fully oaked but not overdone, with toast on the finish. Good Argentine Chardonnay. Imported by Billington Imports.",86,18,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4146","Spain","Not every wine is easy to read: this one is a case in point. The nose offers sweet toffee and apricot, while the palate starts out toasty and dry before unveiling ripe peach and brown sugar. The dosage on this wine is unusual. A funky bubbly that's worth a try.",86,20,"Catalonia","Pinot Noir",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"4147","Italy","This white wine is so big and dense, it drinks like a red.

It's thick and chewy with golden saturation and pulpy extraction.",91,82,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"4148","Argentina","Hands down, this is the finest Pinot Noir from South America that I've ever tasted, and that includes Chile, Argentina and anyplace else. Italy's Piero Incisa della Rocchetta of Sassicaia fame started this project in 2004, and it's now finding a groove. This wine is as elegant as Burgundy but as full of flavor as something from California. The color is rosy, the aromas beguiling, and the meeting of oak and fruit just perfect. Terrific for contemplating on its own or with food. Versatility should be its middle name.",94,100,"Other","Pinot Noir",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

"4150","Argentina","Big and fruity, with notes of rubber and graphite on the bouquet. Textured and pretty full-bodied, the berry, cassis and pepper flavors come across as dedicated and real.

"4153","Chile","Fairly rich and full, this wine offers good texture and ripe citrus, pineapple and herb aromas.

Good acidity provides lift and a fresh tang.",85,10,"Colchagua Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4154","Chile","The red-berry aromas and flavors suffer from a tinge of bell peppers.

"4156","Australia","An opening scent of freshly cut grass is followed by some earthy low tones and an intense lemon note in the mouth.

"4158","Argentina","Harsh and less than clear on the nose despite a lack of oak. The palate is pithy and hot, with bitter apple and apricot flavors in front of a similarly pithy finish that brings banana into the fold. Sweet and heavy on the finish, which isn't all that surprising given its 14.5% alcohol level.",83,11,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4159","Argentina","From vines planted in 1932, this Pinot Noir is simply beautiful. It's bigger and more dense than its younger brother, No. 55, but maybe a tad less elegant and a bit more cellar worthy. The aromas are a blend of fine French oak and natural Pinot aromas of tea, cherry and raspberry. Mineral and coffee appear late on the finish.

"4161","Argentina","Intensely colored and miles better than the label's troubled basic Tempranillo, this is an Argentinean rendition of Spain's workhorse grape that showcases berry and plum flavors, plenty of oak and ample chocolate and espresso on the finish.

"4173","New Zealand","Despite 60% new oak, the first thing you notice about this wine is its gorgeously pure black-cherry fruit. Sure, there's a hint of toast and cedar, but the size and weight comes from ripe fruit and skilled winemaking, not cooperage.

"4184","Italy","Older vines from the named vineyard provide the fruit for this 100% Sangiovese, barrique-aged Super Tuscan. The cherry, tart-berry and chocolate aromas pick up vibrant licorice accents as they blossom into full flavors on the palate.

Black cherries and cola are touched with a hint of green tea and a kiss of toasty oak. Silky soft on the finish, making it great to drink now, but with this balance it should age at least a few years without a problem.",90,26,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"4225","Spain","Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine.

"4240","New Zealand","Despite the fact that Otago isn't known as Sauvignon Blanc country, winemaker Matt Dicey has bottled a lean, racy Sauvignon that's herbaceous, not vegetal.

"4243","New Zealand","Starts off with appealing oatmeal and toast aromas that complement ripe peaches and oranges.

"4246","France","Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging.

It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive. Great with grilled meat; drink now through 2015.",95,50,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"4252","Argentina","From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec.

"4254","Austria","A solidly structured wine, with a chalky mineral character that promises some good aging potential.

"4258","New Zealand","The very ripe flavors of pears and peaches are a little sweet, but nicely balanced by a cool edge of lime-tinged acids that provide focus to the fruit-bowl flavors.

This is on the path to greatness; give it 5–6 years and more.",94,80,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4265","France","Rich, full, powerful Chardonnay, with yellow fruits balanced with lemon, green apple and white currants.

"4267","France","A full, concentrated wine, impressive for the vintage, offering solid structure, powerful tannins and ripe berry and red stone fruit flavors.

"4268","Portugal","An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names.

"4271","Argentina","Starts with apple covered in oak-based caramel and vanilla, but loses its focus as it evolves.

"4275","New Zealand","A soft, gentle style of Sauvignon Blanc, with gooseberry and nectarine fruit that seems almost creamy across the palate.

"4283","Argentina","Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful.

Soft peach and pear fruit is accented by musky, spicy flavors that turn lean and citrusy on the finish.",86,14,"Marlborough","Riesling",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4301","New Zealand","Martinborough isn't known for Sauvignon Blanc, but this is a solid example. A complex nose of melon, passion fruit, green pea and bitter green herbs turns crisp and bright in the mouth, with sweet-pea and mint flavors.",86,15,"Martinborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3
"4302","New Zealand","Classic N.Z. Riesling aromas of pears, limes and Granny Smith apples lead into a medium-weight version that's less austere and citrusy than many of its compatriots.

"4306","Argentina","There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.",92,55,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"4308","Argentina","Coconut and inky black fruit melt into an ultrarich and layered bouquet, and that's the perfect entree to the wine's sweet, broad, chocolaty black fruit flavors that come with a cool mint accent.

"4309","France","A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity. It has some of the sensuous character of good Volnay, opening into ripeness. Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure.",92,89,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4

"4311","Argentina","Full, dark and minty, with aromatic notes of coconut and ink. One look, sniff and sip tells you this is a dark, ripe wine with extract.

Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",89,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4312","France","A freshly perfumed wine, with attractive bright cherry flavors that have a lift and crispness to them. The tannins are persistent and dry, layering with the plum skin acidity. This is not a rich wine, but it makes a fascinating alternative to red Burgundy. Would work well with salmon dishes.",88,40,"Loire Valley","Pinot Noir",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"4313","Argentina","At 15% alcohol and with a nose full of prune, blazing oak and simmering blackberry jam, this is not for the weak. In fact, it may not be for the strong, because while we like the wine's sun-baked, ultraripe personality, we also acknowledge that it's teetering on the brink and probably won't age for very long.",88,23,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"4317","New Zealand","It's the odd Kiwi producer whose Riesling is more expensive than their Sauvignon Blanc, but it shows where the priorities are at this winery.

"4319","New Zealand","Starts off well, with aromas of toast, vanilla and black cherries. The attack is rich and sweet as well, but then the wine turns a bit drying and herbal on the finish. Needs time—but will the fruit hold?",86,35,"Hawke's Bay","Merlot",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"4320","New Zealand","The Corbans house style seems to de-emphasizes the ultrapungent elements of Sauvignon Blanc, focusing instead on grapefruit and, in this case, white nectarine. It's a delicate wine that goes down easy.",85,13,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"4325","Argentina","Deep and juicy Malbec with aromas of violets, blackberry, coconut shavings and mineral. There's also a cedary element to the nose and palate.

"4327","Australia","Because of the extreme heat of 2008, this wine does show a touch of warmth on the finish and should probably be consumed young, but there's no crime in that. It's a luscious blend of lime custard and roasted cashew that's rich without being heavy, and finishes long and clean.",91,35,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2

"4329","Argentina","Alamos takes Merlot to the next level with this ripe, jammy, crusty offering.

"4330","Argentina","Pure and stout, with prime black-fruit aromas supported by toasty oak and mineral-like char.

"4334","Argentina","Concha Y Toro's Argentine property seems to be getting it right with Malbec.

"4336","New Zealand","Smells ripe, with melon and passion fruit predominating, but by the finish Marlborough's trademark green-pepper and grapefruit flavors come on strong—maybe too assertively for some tasters. Crisp and dry; a good palate refresher.",85,15,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"4338","Chile","Dark, with aromas of spiced plums, earth, bark, and a rich, chocolatey note. Heavy and dense, the syrupy texture carries plummy, peppery flavors through to a long, rich finish.

"4340","France","One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity. There are tannins, but this is lighter than in some vintages, a wine for short-term aging.",91,118,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4341","France","A wine that starts with ripe citrus flavors, then moves easily into soft richness as the spicy wood and sweet peach flavors come through strongly. The wood is dominant, but not excessive. Full, ripe and still young.",91,100,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4342","France","A rich wine that shows the power of Gevrey, even in a lesser vintage. The fruit fills the glass with aromas of red plums, sweet raspberries and cranberry juice.

"4455","Chile","Fleshy and full-bodied, with milk chocolate, raisin, cassis, char and leather all making for a serious bouquet. Olive, prune, blackberry and more coat the powerful, whole palate.

"4456","Chile","Kicks off with some herbal, foresty notes but then finds its fruit in the form of ripe plum and blackberry. The palate offers all the black fruit you could ask for as well as a dollop of chocolate fudge. Comes up a bit short of the upper echelon but still it has a lot of positives.

"4458","New Zealand","Textbook Marlborough SB, from a large winery that helped establish the style.

"4459","Italy","An attractive retro label doesn't set you up for the very ripe fruit and almost Californian profile of this new-wave style Chianti.

It's a stylish, appealing wine that's drinking well right now.",87,15,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4460","Italy","Plummy fruit supported by cocoa and herb notes and a decadent, overripe quality seen in no other 1998s. The ripe, supple mouthfeel provides sweet, if not overly nuanced, fruit.

"4461","Italy","A mildly gamy, slightly sauvage note adds interest to this well-oaked wine. Cherry, cinnamon-toast and menthol aromas open to a palate of deep cherry fruit with earthy accents. The feel is supple, and black-cherry and licorice notes show on the long, smoothly tannic finish. The toasty oak and fruit work in harmony here.",87,21,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4462","Italy","After some sulfur blows off, dark cherry aromas with leather accents come forward.

There's decent length to the dry, mildly pepper-and-licorice-tinged finish.",87,13,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4463","Italy","This smooth, balanced offering shows plenty of cherry, leather and cedar flavors.

"4470","Argentina","Strong and extracted, and needing a few minutes to settle. The palate is concentrated, dark and chewy, with ripe berry flavors that hint at being medicinal and raisiny but don't fully go there. While this is nothing earth-shattering, for $12 it's complete and should offer mass appeal.",88,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"4472","France","Bouchard's village wines express the nature of each place well. None more so than this firmly tannic Nuits-Saint-Georges.

"4473","Chile","Aromatically, this has pure Casablanca scents of tropical fruit, citrus and mineral.

Elegant and finessed; a racy specimen with good character.",88,13,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4474","Argentina","Tight, rubbery and smoky at first, and then it shows more vanilla and sweet berry fruit after it has opened up. The mouthfeel is nice and fulfilling, while the flavors of black fruit, nutmeg and mild toast are pleasing. Nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary here. Just good red wine at a good price.",87,12,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4475","Argentina","Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities.

"4476","Argentina","A veneer of oak and aromas of root beer greet you, while cherry and raspberry flavors work the palate. It's a lively, tannic wine with a candied, slightly resiny/minty flavor profile and finish. Best with food.",85,16,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4477","Argentina","Starts out good, with menthol and wintergreen dominating the nose. The palate is forward and endowed with a lot of red-fruit flavors, but the mouthfeel lets it down. There's too much bounding acidity and not nearly enough lushness.",85,40,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4478","Argentina","Don't let the bright purple color and plum/prune aromas fool you: the wine looks deeper and fleshier than it is.

"4479","Argentina","Argentinean Rieslings come along as often as Haley's comet. But this clean, round wine is pretty good in its own right.

"4482","Chile","A nicely sculpted white wine; fresh on the nose, with talcum powder, flowers and citrus aromas.

"4485","Italy","The traditional flavor profile shows ripe cherries, herbs, dried tomatoes and a touch of chocolate. Good acidity supports the fruit and contributes to the overall brisk, lively feel. Closes with tart fruit and medium, firm tannins that show a little bite. This will work well with tomato-based pasta sauces.",87,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"4487","Italy","There's cherry and licorice on the nose of this crisp, lighter-style wine. Bright, tart fruit and cocoa accents follow on the palate, and it's bright and moderately tannic on the finish. A good pizza-pasta partner, this will even out over the next 12 months and drink well through 2004.",87,9,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4488","Italy","There's superripe fruit and a soft, easy feel to this very jammy wine. Although not complex, the big black-cherry fruit delivers a lot of flavor and the supple texture is quite pleasurable. The finish is plush, with tart acids. Widely appealing for current consumption.",87,15,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4489","Italy","Aromas of cherries, herbs, leather and dried tomatoes on the nose open to a mouthful of cherry fruit accented by licorice and coffee notes. The texture is smooth, even and dry. The full but ripe tannins on the finish have just the right amount of bite.",87,22,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4490","Italy","A solid wine, with a core of cherry and dark plum fruit. The nose is especially nice, with prune, leather and clove accents. Turns spicier and somewhat woodier through the palate and onto the finish. Shows good acidity and even tannins. Drink now.",87,15,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4491","Italy","The ripe fruit here bears lots of oak, yielding a black plum and licorice flavor profile, but it's pleasing and balanced on the palate. Sweet wood and cherry aromas play out on the fairly tannic finish. Good now, better in a year, but you have to have a taste for wood.",87,12,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4492","Italy","A slightly muted nose of dark cherry and toast offers hints of rose and tar. Similar flavors play on the palate with a touch of chocolate and a smooth mouthfeel. Long and dry, the espresso-tinged finish is elegant. The depth of fruit can be sensed and this should open up with short-term cellaring, displaying more depth and richness in a year's time.",87,14,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4493","Austria","A rounded style of Sauvignon Blanc, but one that doesn't lose sight of its herbaceous element. So there is crispness, a vivacious acidity, but also flavors of creamy apple and ripe pear. To drink this year.",88,27,"Burgenland","Sauvignon Blanc",47.1537165,16.2688797,3
"4494","Chile","A pricey Syrah by Chilean standards, but at least it's a good wine. The nose offers cookie, violet, wet clay and herbal olive notes along with black fruit aromas, while the palate is packed with sweet roasted berry and dark plum flavors. A bit minty and candied on the finish as the oak treatment rises up and demands to be noticed.",88,30,"Cachapoal Valley","Syrah",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3
"4495","Italy","Here is an oak-aged Chardonnay with overtones of toast, vanilla and roasted almond that sit squarely besides well-integrated notes of exotic fruit, honey and apricot. The oak element is strong, however, and transfers to the mouth in the form of intensity and length.",88,22,"Piedmont","Chardonnay",45.0522366,7.5153885,2

"4497","Italy","Adènzia is a Chardonnay-based wine with 13% Grillo grown in white, chalky Sicilian soils that offers a drying mineral note behind fresh aromas of spring flowers and exotic fruit.

"4500","Argentina","Looks good in the glass, and with citrus essence, plum and cherry aromas, and spice notes it offers a controlled but pleasant bouquet. Cherry, plum and spice flavors work well with the wine's racy acidity and solid structure. Powerful and toasty on the finish.",86,20,"Other","Pinot Noir",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"4501","Italy","Shows the heat of the vintage in its slightly cooked-fruit aromas and flavors. Think dried cherries, prune and molasses, but without being too heavy; balanced by supple tannins and a dusty sensation on the finish.",85,10,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4502","Argentina","Nice on the nose. The palate is steady but on the leaner side, with prickly tannins joining berry fruit, chocolate and toast. A tighter, Patagonian style of Malbec, meaning it's firm as opposed to lush.",85,14,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"4503","Argentina","A little choppy and tannic, with thin red-fruit aromas. The palate is of medium depth, with a bit of tannin-driven rawness to make things a little harder than ideal. Otherwise it's steady and warming.",84,19,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4504","New Zealand","Nicely ripened without being overripe, this rather soft Sauvignon marries peach and melon fruit with a dollop of grassy herbaceousness. Pretty and easy to drink; best yet from this winery. Imported by Via Pacifica Imports.",88,17,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4505","Chile","This winery has been getting things right lately, and the '04 Cabernet is deep and fruity, with a touch of oak and ripe, integrated tannins. Flavors of dark fruit are offset by chocolate and toast flavors, while the finish is rich but relaxed. Great for the money. Imported by Vin Divino.",88,10,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4506","Italy","Shows overpowering cedar and heavy toast aromatics and an even feel, but the impressions are more oak than fruit-derived. Still, black plum and sweet spice flavors are in there. Finishes with cocoa notes and chalky, broad tannins. This may merit a higher score in time.",86,27,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4507","Chile","This light and lemony wine would make a good afternoon sipper, or a tasty match for grilled fish. The spicy, citrus fruit shows good intensity midpalate. Finishes clean, with moderate length and herb notes.",86,8,"Maule Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"4508","Italy","Opens with aromas of red plums, cedar, leather and meat. Flavors of dark cherry and earth, and a light, bright mouthfeel follow. Finishes dry and even with soft tannins, dark fruit and chocolate.",86,25,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"4512","Italy","Once a sulfury note blows off, this wine reveals dark cherry fruit with licorice, tar and spice accents. Nice texture. Plum and black pepper notes add interest and the long, dry finish closes it nicely. Drinkable now, but better in a year.",86,11,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4513","Italy","Herb and licorice notes complement the berry and sour cherry fruit in this bright offering. Quite youthful, a sulfur note on the nose has to blow off to reveal the essentially good fruit within. The acids here are high and the wine is a touch too racy now, but it will cut right through your pasta's tomato sauce.",86,11,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4514","France","A wine that is all about crispness, structure and bright fruits. The creamy texture from lees aging gives a rounder dimension, but the main thrust here is minerality coupled with delicious acidity.",88,20,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4515","Italy","This is an extremely oak-driven Chardonnay with determined notes of toasted almond and toast that stand up to the natural fruit. This is a hot climate white, so there are plenty of mature fruit aromas of peach and apricot to match all that wood. Part of Pisciotto's Italian fashion designers collection, the bottle was designed by Alberta Ferretti.",88,21,"Sicily & Sardinia","Chardonnay",37.5999938,14.0153557,2

"4518","Argentina","Quite tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple and passion fruit.

Not a classic Sauvignon, but it has its virtues.",84,18,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4519","Argentina","California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth.

More for those wanting a simple, sweeter style.",84,9,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4520","Argentina","Cabernet may always struggle to achieve ripeness in Patagonia, but Schroeder is getting pretty decent plum and blackberry character out of this wine.

"4521","Argentina","A little buttery and wayward, but not without its good points, which include ripe apple, melon, citrus and papaya flavors. The body is fairly hefty and the finish carries heat, but overall offers decent fruit-salad flavors and pretty good balance.",84,8,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4522","Argentina","Opens with brambly, leathery aromas; later shows some true Tempranillo character, namely body, tannin and dark-fruit flavors. This is not flawed, but it is rather oaky and demanding.",84,12,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1
"4523","Argentina","Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors.

"4525","Chile","In tasting this vintage for the second time, we found better balance than originally but still we encountered dull fruit, a lot of earthiness and leather, and some pickle barrel.

Imported by Global Vineyard Importers.",87,45,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4526","Chile","Deep and meaty, with a midnight hue and brooding aromatics. Ripe plum and blackberry dominate the chewy palate, while the finish is heady, with cola and espresso notes.

"4534","Italy","This is decent, basic Chianti with a tart cherry and spice profile. It took a little time for some sulfur on the nose to blow off, but when it did, the flavors were solid and the mouthfeel decent. Shows some tobacco and leather on the modest finish. Not complex, but good for every day.",85,9,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4535","Italy","A young wine with classic tart cherry flavors and an added chalky note that provides some complexity. Finishes with firm tannins and some dark chocolate and licorice notes. Should be even better in a year.",85,9,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"4537","Italy","The sour cherry fruit and cedar accents here are in balance, right down the middle of the divide between the old and new styles. This wine cuts a fairly lean profile, as do more than few of the 1998s, and finishes dry with moderate tannins.",85,19,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"4540","Argentina","Dark and a little baked on the nose, with prune, fig and earthy aromas.

Good Merlot for the price.",87,13,"Other","Merlot",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

The palate has thickness and beef, while the flavors run creamy, rich and sweet. Finishes with a slick of oaky butter and woodspice. Good for Chilean Pinot, but needs some fine tuning in future years.",87,18,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4542","Chile","Salinic and pungent, with celery, green citrus and nettle aromas. This is pure SB, although it's not 100% SB because Secreto always has a little something else in the blend.

"4545","Australia","Round, velvety and mouthfilling, this is a satisfying Merlot at a bargain price.

Drink now.",86,11,"Australia Other","Merlot",-25.274398,133.775136,3
"4546","Argentina","Despite some initial sweet gummy aromas, things settle into form on the nose.

"4547","Argentina","If you like a muscular, sweet, full-bodied wine with chunky wild berry flavors topped with a dollop of raisin and chocolate, this is it.

"4554","Italy","A medium-weight wine built on a core of tart cherry fruit that wears licorice and tobacco accents. Even and dry on the palate, it has a good chalky mouthfeel and dry, even tannins on the finish. Not flamboyant, but solid.",85,19,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4555","Italy","This medium-weight wine displays ripe cherry fruit, heavy cedar accents and an easy, balanced mouthfeel.

"4558","Italy","Plenty of cherries and a large dose of not-so-toasty oak are the core of this medium-weight red. A slight earthiness on the nose and woody tannins on the back end frame a solid palate that's full of cherry and vanilla flavors.",85,19,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4559","Italy","There's berry and rhubarb-like aromas and dried cherry flavors that have hints of tobacco, vanilla and leather. All of this sounds good, but the elements seemed to disappear too quickly in the glass. After only a few moments the wine seemed a pale shadow of the initial elements, and finished dry and a bit hollow.",84,11,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4560","Argentina","A nice, highly affordable bottling that highlights Argentina's value potential. The palate is soft, almost silky, with melted tannins and full flavors of raspberry and ripe plums.

"4562","Chile","Chono is one of the better Chilean rosé wines we've come across. It has that Mediterranean look, smell and flare to it. The color is attractive, the nose fresh and clean, and the flavors of orange and fine herbs are crisp and on the spot. Good for this summer.",87,11,"Maipo Valley","Syrah",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"4565","Chile","Nice Pinot, with light tomato, mint, lemon peel and red plum aromas. The palate is dry and refreshing, with purity and citrusy raspberry/cherry flavors.

"4567","Australia","This medium-bodied Pinot Noir features pronounced herbal and spice elements that may not find universal acclaim. The oak-derived cinnamon and cedar notes dominate the nose, and the flavors lean toward wintergreen or sassafras. That said, there is ample cherry fruit as well, and a silky texture that lingers on the finish. Probably best now and over the next couple of years.",86,26,"Tasmania","Pinot Noir",-41.4545196,145.9706647,3
"4568","Italy","Here's a rich and sophisticated Chardonnay with intense aromas of stone fruit, apricot, grapefruit and white almond.

But the best thing about it is the low price tag.",86,10,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"4569","Argentina","Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy.

"4571","Argentina","If this isn't one of the strangest, most unique Sauvignon Blancs on the market, then please tell us what is. With a tan/peach color, this wine has its own agenda.

"4573","Chile","This Chilean wine displays two personalities. The nose offers aromas of ripe peaches and cream, with honey and buttered-toast accents. On the tongue it turns crisp and tart, with citrus and green-apple flavors and fairly sharp acidity. It finishes short and bright.",84,8,"Maule Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"4574","Italy","After an unusual, almost saline note passed, this wine presented a bouquet of dark cherry, chocolate and toast. This opens to a mouth of mild cherry flavors with a dry even feel and a black-plum and cocoa finish that displays slightly edgy tannins.",84,15,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4575","Italy","The light cherry aromas and flavors with herb accents show a slight candied quality.

"4579","France","So light, dry and taut, you might mistake this for a Sauvignon Blanc with its grapefruit profile and high acidity.

The flavors are quite red in scope, with a twinge of buttery oak adding softness. Licorice and another tick of wood take care of the finish. A fresh, forward wine for everyday use.",86,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4614","Argentina","Licorice, dark spice and berry pie right down to the buttery crust make for a decent nose. In the mouth, it's creamy and warm, with full-bodied plum and raisin flavors alongside a shot of acidity and chocolate on the finish. Not very complex but it delivers the basics.",85,13,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"4615","Argentina","This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.",82,8,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1

"4617","Argentina","Something seems afoot with Sur de los Andes' so-called Gran Reserva Malbecs. Both the 2004 and epecially this '05 are wines that don't handle their oak well. This wine has an aromatic package of green tobacco and ash, while the wood burns its way through the palate. A rough ride that gets marginally better with a lot of swirling and patience.",81,25,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4618","Italy","The juice here seems good, with dark cherry, licorice and chocolate elements, decent structure, and fine tannins. However, you need to get past a strong sulfur component on the nose that just doesn't yield.",82,28,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4619","Italy","This is a big burly wine that just has too many off aromas.

"4621","Chile","Intensely purple, with aromas of char, shoe polish, coffee, black fruits and herbs. Thick but balanced, with juicy, fresh-styled blackberry and dark plum flavors.

"4624","Chile","Full, rubbery and robust on the nose, with earthy berry aromas. The palate shows cassis, cherry and raspberry along with spiky, zesty acidity.

"4625","Argentina","Heavy, inky and seemingly a bit overripe, with grassy, doughy, cake-like aromas. The palate is simple and soft, and it comes with deep berry, candy and herbal flavors. More herbal on the finish, with coconut entering the picture.",86,14,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4626","Chile","Toasty and relatively smooth, with a comfortable nose and body. Smoothness is this wine's prime attribute, while the flavors are your basic apple and citrus.

"4627","New Zealand","This is 100% barrel-fermented, which has left its mark on the wine. There's some crisp apple and citrus fruit flavors, but toast and butter notes play the starring role.

"4629","Chile","Good from the start, with an aromatic mix of black olive, berry and cherry. The palate offers more of the same: cherry, plum and pimiento.

"4633","Argentina","Lots of red-fruit aromas send it out in familiar fashion, while the palate runs a bit zesty and acidic. This is not as soft and rich as in the past; the flavors rest on bright plum and cherry fruit with plenty of acidic kick. Solid but regular as Malbec goes, and probably in need of food to give the acids something to work on.",85,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4634","Argentina","Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky.

A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.",85,9,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"4635","Argentina","Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors. There's a wave of milk chocolate to the fairly smooth but basic finish, and overall it's fine but doesn't get you excited. Only 250 cases made.",85,20,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4636","Argentina","The nose is a dark, clumsy confluence of rubber, stewed cherry and horseradish, and the palate is both tangy and bouncy, with a hard feel and plenty of acidic kick. Misses too many marks to rate better.",81,13,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1

"4639","Argentina","Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.",80,10,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4640","Argentina","Rowdy and aggressive stuff; where's the charm and poise, even in a value-priced wine? The nose is rambling and penetrating, while the palate is tart like sucking candy. A raw wine that should be better.",80,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4641","France","This is breathtaking stuff, incredibly complex on the nose, where it features hints of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, cassis, pepper and asphalt. It would be a wine to sit and smell all day if it weren't so delicious to taste. Rich waves of cassis fruit cascade over the palate without losing complexity, buffered by incredibly supple tannins. The virtually endless finish confirms the quality. Drink now–2030+.",98,450,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4642","France","Sure, this wine shows the effects of the hot summer in its slightly jammy raspberry flavors, but there's also incredible complexity to complement the fruit intensity—Asian spices, tea, pepper and meat, to name just a few nuances. It's all wrapped in a blanket of soft tannins, but stays fresh-tasting thanks to great minerality despite low acidity. Drink now–2030 or beyond.",97,96,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4643","Spain","As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet.

"4645","Australia","The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5–8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more.

"4648","Chile","Varietally correct and ripe, with a lot of creamy oak that creates a slight lactic mouthfeel. Thus if you prefer a more acidic, crisp wine, this might not work for you.

"4650","Chile","Slightly hard, burnt and earthy at first, with dark fruit sitting below that cap. The palate is tannic, thus the mouthfeel clamps down and closes up like a clam. More generous and savory in terms of flavors, with roasted black fruit and aged cheese notes. Narrow and grapey on the finish, but legit.",86,10,"Maipo Valley","Syrah",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"4652","Argentina","Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry.

"4653","Chile","Nicely laid out, with mineral, pungent green fruit and citrus aromas making for a good opening. The palate is crisp and chalky, with lime and grapefruit flavors.

"4655","Argentina","A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking. The nose is familiar, with basic berry aromas that have some sharpness, while the palate is solid if a bit tangy, with lively cherry flavors. Juicy and fresh, although slightly angular in feel. Ages only three months in oak, hence the fruit-forwardness.",86,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4656","Argentina","The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty.

"4660","France","Delas's cuvée parcellaire is a rich wine that's almost syrupy in its concentration and tannic strength. But this definitely has plenty of fruit for balance, mixing cassis with black olive, espresso, cinnamon and clove. Not quite as rich as the '03, but still a classic, with great persistence on the finish. Best after 2015.",94,128,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4661","France","Intoxicatingly fruity and forward on the nose, this wine—a blend of Le Méal and Les Greffieux—follows up with rich layers of black fruit.

"4662","France","Rich, creamy and lush, this is like no other Clape Cornas before or since. Jammy raspberry fruit coats the palate, yet without seeming simple or heavy because there's also a remarkable sense of minerality and balance. Long on the finish, buffered by soft tannins. As this ages, expect to see some of the jamminess recede and more of the minerality emerge. Drink 2010–2025, possibly longer.",94,82,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4663","France","Named after Alphonse Jr's father (Edmond Alphonse), this is the top wine from the Mellot estate. With its extra bottle age and wood flavors this is not typical Sancerre.

"4667","Chile","Arguably not up to the De Martino standards, and definitely not up to the price.

"4668","Chile","Brilliant in color, with lots of oak and derivative aromas. The palate is sweet and rich, as if syrup and caramel had been infused into the package.

Imported by Laird & Company.",85,17,"Maule Valley","Malbec",-36,-72,3
"4669","Chile","Dark and tight aromas, things like coffee and charred meat, make for a brooding bouquet.

"4670","New Zealand","As this wine's grape sourcing has changed over the years, Goldwater has struggled to maintain its quality. This year's version is lean and tart, zesty and citrusy.

"4673","Argentina","Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal.

"4683","Spain","A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it.

This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular.

"4694","France","Very sweet aromas of ripe red and white cherries and canned peaches belie this wine's dry palate while the shortish finish shows an appealing citrusy crispness.

"4695","Argentina","A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate.

"4698","Australia","A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white.

"4721","New Zealand","With its relatively modest alcohol (10.5%) and lovely sugar-acid balance, this Riesling could pass for an excellent spätlese. Aromas are floral and fruit-filled, yielding hints of apple, pineapple and even a suggestion of red berries, while the flavors echo with apples, stone fruit and strawberries.

"4768","Italy","Brawny and bold with impeccable depth and balance. Dark fudge, forest berry and coffee take center stage with menthol coolness, caramel and marzipan from the chorus line.

"4769","Australia","Jim Barry's first Florita is a delicious wine with Meyer lemon aromas and a dry, smooth, austere feel. The first sip is an intense rush of green apple, pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon flavors; the second sip, it's demure, almost coy, in its minerality and auserity. Ever-changing, with a kaleidoscope of flavors and sensations. Drink now through 2020. Imported by Negociants USA, Inc. Cellar Selection.",93,30,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"4771","Argentina","Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry.

"4772","Chile","Tropical in style, which for Los Vascos is as expected. Year after year, this Casablanca Chardonnay tastes, smells and seems more like Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay.

"4773","Chile","Staunch berry and earth aromas are fine. The mouthfeel, however, is an issue due to fierce tannic bite and chunkiness.

"4778","Argentina","Purple in color and smells like sweet fruit, citrus peel and powdered drink mix.

Not much grace or precision, but not an overtly poor wine either.",83,11,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"4780","Argentina","Smells like black cherry Kool-Aid, so don't be surprised that it tastes snappy and angular, with flavors of cherry and raspberry. Crisp and lean all the way through, with some grit and scour to the finish. Not much stuffing or size, but generous with the candied flavor.",83,18,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"4782","Argentina","Fresh like a peach on the nose, with a bit of warm radiator dust.

"4783","Spain","Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness.

"4785","Australia","Plunk down the extra coin for the JC Reserve Riesling.

"4796","France","One of the best values in the Le Moine lineup, this isn't all that dark, but don't let looks deceive you.

"4799","Chile","Candied but also peppery and herbal, and without much depth or complexity. The palate is tight, acidic, sheering and tastes of snappy, edgy cherry and raspberry fruit. Then an oaky, vanilla dryness sets in. Solid and fresh, but hardly a head-turner.",85,16,"Casablanca Valley","Merlot",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4800","France","Smoky, toasty aromas lead into a wine that brings some fruit tannins to the mix, with flavors of sweet plums and spice to go with the wood. The wine has some potential, perhaps for aging 2-3 years.",85,23,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4801","Chile","A ripe, sweet, soft style of Chardonnay that pours on the banana and pear aromas and flavors. The feel runs toward the valley, and the finish is all vanilla and sweet, melony fruit.

"4806","Argentina","Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum.

"4808","Chile","Rich and complex from the start, the nose and palate of this wine feature a fruit melange of mango, melon, banana wrapped in nicely integrated oak.

"4809","Chile","This is what vineyard selection and winemaker intervention can do to enrich a wine.  Everything here is on steroids.

"4812","Chile","Bacon and lavender are prominent on the meaty, slightly muddled nose, which unfolds gracefully if given lots and lots of time.

"4814","Argentina","This yellowish SB from Argentina's northern Salta region is a strange bird that has never caught our fancy.

It doesn't hurt that the oak is high-quality stuff either, as the elements blend together in a harmonious whole. A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.",87,14,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4844","Italy","This unique red sparkler from Piedmont offers cherry and earth aromas before turning lighter on the palate, with slightly sweet strawberry flavors and a soft mousse.  Aunique wine, the finish has nice length and appealingly full fruit flavors that have appeal even to serious wine drinkers.",87,23,"Piedmont","Sangiovese",45.0522366,7.5153885,3
"4845","Chile","Alejandro Hernandez, professor of viticulture and oenology at Chile's Catholic University, produced this attractive bottle of Chardonnay to drink tonight. Aromas of toasted oak, apple and pineapple open. The viscous mouthfeel is supported by crisp acidity. Offers a long apple-pineapple finish with a butterscotch finale.",87,12,"Central Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"4846","Chile","A refreshing wine, with nicely ripened fruit and exceptional balance, that's pleasant in every way and a super value, too.  The fruit goes beyond citrus into more deeply flavored apricot and pear, and modest sur lie aging adds creamy, buttery notes.  This is a lovely wine and one of the best values of the year in Sauvignon/Fume Blanc.",87,10,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4847","Chile","A light and crisp Chardonnay that leans more to the style of Mâcon than Monterey. Mild apple, peach, tropical fruit and citrus notes on the nose open to a dry, slightly reserved palate with orange and spice elements. Bright acidity keeps it lively and it finishes dry with a classy, slightly chalky note.",86,11,"Colchagua Valley","Chardonnay",-34.6761419,-71.097317,2
"4848","Chile","Ripe berries, black cherries, earth, chocolate and herbs all mark this nose of this solid Merlot. Fairly full on the palate, it has a supple feel and plum and berry flavors. The finish is reserved, maybe even a bit austere, with dry, semisweet chocolate notes on the tart plum fruit.",86,15,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"4850","Argentina","Heavy hayfield aromas are oxidized, and the flavors of almond peel, citrus pith and baked banana do nothing to impress. Not a fresh or healthy wine, if it ever was. Past its prime.",80,12,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4851","Austria","A Riesling that hovers deliciously between Alsace and the German Rheingau. It has the richness of Alsace, but the structure of the Rheingau. And it brings more, because the tight soils of the Hochrain vineyard, with its stony subsoil, brings an intense minerality, which is surrounded by opulent apricot and pineapple fruits. A great wine with enormous potential.",95,74,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"4852","New Zealand","Weighty and slightly oily in the mouth, this is a big, broad-shouldered Riesling that's completely dry. Apple and spice flavors lack the sweetness you might expect, underlined by lemony notes that impart focus to the wine's finish.",89,20,"Central Otago","Riesling",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"4853","Chile","Light in color, and with alluring true-Pinot aromas of brewed tea, cherry jam and cigar box. The approach Kingston takes is to make something in the California style, and this has the size and richness of fruit to qualify as such. A really nice wine that's far from ordinary and shows what Casablanca can do when it's on the right path.",89,18,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4854","Spain","Good color and intriguing aromas of baked fruit, tobacco and mint indicate that you're getting some modern-styled ripeness along with traditional Rioja earth, spice and old man's library. The palate is juicy and mildy fruity, while the finish pushes chocolate, vanilla, baking spice and tannins. Drinkable now but will age for another five years without a problem.",89,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4855","Spain","Ysios is one of the most visually pleasing wineries you'll see. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and it's the town of Laguardia's modern stamp. But until now the wines were just average. This one, however, is far better than that, with pure dried cherry and raspberry flavors bolstered by spicy oak, vanilla and perfect acidity. Drink now–2009. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",89,30,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4856","France","With their biodynamic vineyards, it's no wonder that the Vacherons are able to produce such intense fruit, even in their simplest wines. This is fresh but concentrated, with summer currants and pink grapefruit enriched by a firm structure.",89,27,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"4857","New Zealand","This distinctive Riesling starts with a blast of crushed stone and lime zest, then settles down to offer strident lime-sherbet flavors—slightly sweet—that end on a dry, tactile note. Imported by Kobrand Corporation.",89,23,"Marlborough","Riesling",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4858","New Zealand","This new winery—founded in only 2002—has turned out a wonderfully delicate off-dry Riesling. Floral hints accent lemon and green apple aromas, while the finish lingers elegantly, hitting some lime top notes.",89,17,"Central Otago","Riesling",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"4859","Spain","Bramble bush, graphite, leather and medium-depth fruit are the opening notes on this qualm-free, fairly muscular Rioja. Dark cherry and raspberry flavors run the palate, and they are followed by a warm, milk chocolate-tinged finish. Very nice for a 2002.",89,31,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4860","Italy","Inkjet black and super concentrated, the wine actually delivers fresh fruit and squeezed berry youthfulness. By the looks of it, you'd expect a massive, oaked, tannic beast, but instead are treated to a wine full of creamy coffee and velvety tobacco leaf flavors. Imported by Vinifera Imports.",91,110,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4861","Italy","Strawberry, cherry, apple cider, almond paste, caramel, hints of mint and deeper notes of chocolate and espresso make for an engaging and complex nose. Pronounced acidity is backed by firm tannins and a smooth, spicy finish. Imported by Winebow.",91,70,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4862","France","The dominant pear and melon notes actually come across as a bit austere despite the wine not being hugely mineral upfront. Where this wine shows its pedigree is on the long finish, which picks up anise and flint notes and a rich, plush texture. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",91,66,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"4863","Argentina","This is one of three new single-vineyard Malbecs from venerable Trapiche, and it proves that with rich, old-vine fruit winemaker Daniel Pi can make ultramodern vino that will please New World palates the world over. This particular bottling is a potent brew of well-oaked juice that shows wintergreen, menthol and a ton of blackberry, black cherry and coffee. It isn't fooling around, that's for sure. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",91,35,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4864","Italy","Red berry fruit, anise seed, mint tea and dried flowers are attractive components to a bouquet with a strong fruit compote or jammy quality.

"4865","Italy","This wine boasts a very nice balance of enticing aromas such as cola, mint tea, basil leaf, chocolate and dried tobacco. Yet there was enough fruit and berry flavors to ensure a long cellar life. Plump and velvety in the mouth, with mouth cleansing freshness on the finish. A Marc de Grazia selection, various U.S. importers.",91,65,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4866","Chile","Dusty, mild red fruit aromas bring hints of flowers, sucking candy and vanilla cream. The palate is bouncy, with lively but herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes dry enough, with touches of vanilla, spice and bramble.",84,10,"Colchagua Valley","Merlot",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4867","Chile","Dusty, peachy and sort of flat on the nose, but overall it does well for $8. The mouthfeel is round but will be short-lived, so drink it soon to capture the lemon, orange and pineapple flavors.",84,8,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"4868","France","From the village of Epineuil, north of Chablis, comes this lightweight red with attractive fresh fruits, but a curious petrol aroma. It is soft and light, although there is a hint of dry tannins. Screwcap.",84,19,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4869","Chile","Dry and peppery on the nose, and then there's a simple, pithy palate with lime-driven flavors and green apple. Tastes pithy on the finish, with Key lime finishing notes. Doesn't really show much.",84,9,"Colchagua Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4870","France","The 2007 vintage was not kind to red wines from the Hautes Côtes, the vineyards behind the main slope of Burgundy. Manuel Olivier has made an attractively fresh, strawberry-flavored wine, but it lacks intensity, relying on soft fruit and fresh acidity.",84,20,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4871","Chile","A blast of chocolaty mint opens up this confected, somewhat conflicted Cabernet. And while the nose hints at sweetness, the palate is rather snappy and tannic, with lean, tart flavors of red cherries and plum skins. Fresh in feel but herbal and thin in terms of output.",84,17,"Cachapoal Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3
"4872","Argentina","A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays.",84,10,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"4873","France","With a touch of wood, this wine has some good weight to balance the very fresh raspberry and crisp berry acidity. There is a toasty element, but crisp fruit dominates.",84,18,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4874","Chile","At this price, you can expect an honest, workmanlike everyday wine, and you get that here—along with other qualities that will surprise you. Not least is the fruit, nicely ripened and finely etched, and the spices that dance on the tongue. It's dry, of course, with fine acidity. What stands out is the depth of flavor.",86,8,"Central Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"4875","Chile","Young and grapy, with plenty of heavily toasted oak, this is one Chilean red that could use a year or so to settle down. Right now the fruit is just too unformed and the charred oak too unintegrated, but the solid raw materials should knit together nicely in a relatively short time.",86,9,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4876","Chile","Richly fruity and soft, this wine boasts loads of black-cherry and plum flavors. Clearly made from very ripe fruit, it lacks the herbaceous-vegetal character so often found in Merlot, but also any sense of structure. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat.",85,8,"Rapel Valley","Merlot",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"4877","Chile","A good everyday Chardonnay, this wine's apple and toasted oak notes are supported by brisk acidity and a smooth but lively mouthfeel. The finish is pleasing and displays a nice butterscotch note",85,11,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"4878","Chile","Jammy, soft and juicy, this Cabernet Sauvignon tastes almost like a California field blend. But that's not bad, if not particularly varietally focused. Easy, very drinkable, it's a kind of “Cab-jolais” that can work as a bar pour or party wine.",85,7,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4879","Chile","Sweet caramel, a touch of mintiness, and some earth-tinged cassis grace the nose. That's followed up by simple fruit flavors and a corpulent mouthfeel held together by some light tannins on the finish.",84,7,"Maule Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"4880","Chile","Ripe pear-pineapple fruit is layered with vanilla and tinged with citrus. This is a plump, slightly heavy Chard best served cold at parties and picnics.",84,8,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"4881","Chile","A light Chardonnnay showing  pineapple and pear aromas, and similar flavors that turn quite lemony on the palate. Turns  slightly tart on the finish, but the bright feel and the light flavors make it a good candidate for a bar pour or party wine.",84,7,"Lontué Valley","Chardonnay",-35.0567954,-71.2688602,2
"4882","Chile","Sometimes you just need a cheap, quaffable, crisp dry white wine to drink in copious amounts, and this one will do just fine, thank you. It's citrusy, spicy, and dry, and has enough acid to cleanse the palate.",84,8,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"4883","Austria","An impressive wine that manages to bring out both richness and a wonderful shower of fresh flavors. So the ripe pineapple and pear fruits combine with an edge of spice. Then they are lifted to a great height by the acidity, the fruit skin texture and a final burst of floral intensity. Screwcap.",94,35,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"4884","Australia","In recent years, Schild Estate is making a slew of tasty wines at consumer-friendly prices. Its 2006 Riesling is cut from similar cloth, offering obvious peach and tropical fruit notes that coat the palate. It's a complex mélange of fruit that finishes with dry, mouthwatering flavors but without any strong sense of minerality.",89,15,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"4885","New Zealand","This dry Riesling manages to tie together several disparate elements into a nicely cohesive whole.

"4887","France","Guigal's entry-level Côte-Rôtie seems rather tannic at this moment, but does have ample spice, cassis and prune flavors. Lacks a bit of richness and flesh; give it a few years' time to come back around. Drink 2009–2015.",88,70,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4888","Chile","As good a wine from Conde de Velázquez as we've come across. This reserve-level Cab starts with tight cherry aromas but evolves on the palate with plum, berry and cough drop flavors.

"4891","Italy","This wine has a very pretty nose with a delicate embroidery of forest berry and wild flowers. Yet its structure is full and round with a deep ruby color. Thicker, denser favors come through on the palate like smoked ham, sweet cherry followed by a zesty touch of basil or green herb.

"4893","Argentina","In recent years Michel Torino has been making better and better Malbec, and this vintage is the best we've tasted. It offers sweet fruit and marzipan on the nose, while the big, chewy palate is lush and packed with berries, vanilla and chocolate nesting on pillowy tannins. Very chummy and almost lavish. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",90,15,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"4894","Italy","Shows lovely, complex aromas of plum and cedar, accented with hints of brown sugar, chocolate and spice.

Imported by Vineyard Brands.",90,75,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4895","Chile","Heavy aromas of burnt leaves, rubber and compost overshadow any berry fruit notes, while the palate is creamy in feel, with basic flavors of spiced, earthy cherry and berry. Fairly oaky on the finish and overall a step back in quality from previous vintages.",84,16,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4896","Chile","Sweet aromas of berry pastry and black licorice are moderately convincing, while the palate is reduced and chunky, with thick but dull prune and roasted berry flavors. The finish is more of the same: baked fruit flavors and sweet.",84,10,"Rapel Valley","Syrah",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"4897","Argentina","Red in color, with neutral aromas of red apple skins. The palate is sticky and weighty, and the taste is akin to fruit punch with tangerine on the side. Tastes o.k. but is too full, chunky and heavy to be refreshing",83,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4898","Chile","Chunky and pasty-smelling, with a thick set of berry aromas that rest heavily in the glass. Not very fruity but definitely herbal. Most difficult to deal with are the hard, fierce tannins that result in a gritty mouthfeel and bitterness on the finish. Surprising tough and tannic.",83,25,"Cachapoal Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3
"4899","Chile","There's a sea of basic Cabernet that comes out of Chile every year. This is very much one of the generic, forgettable ones.

"4901","Chile","Attractive and correct berry, plum and cocoa aromas open to a plummy palate, with a round mouthfeel. The cocoa and toast finish has easy tannins. Has all the right elements, but in a rather simple expression, wanting intensity.",83,7,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4902","Chile","Everything is front-end in this Chardonnay. The nose has plenty of tropical fruit, and with some toasted oak in the background.

"4903","Chile","A pleasant and cleanly made quaffing wine with plenty of berry and black-cherry fruit and a strong menthol streak running right through to the finish. A bit rough around the edges; might show better with a country-style dish of stewed chicken.",83,9,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4904","Chile","Orangey aromas wrapped in not very subtle oak open this light-to-medium weight wine. Simple and a bit one-dimensional, it offers light pear flavors and a dry finish. Acceptable as an easy quaff, but not the stuff worthy of reserve designation.",83,14,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"4905","Chile","It's nice to see an ever-increasing number of serviceable kosher wines like this one being made available to consumers from around the world. That said, this one isn't much more than adequate. There's a modest amount of cassis fruit dressed up with earthy chocolate and vaguely minty aromas, but it lacks depth. Still, it's better than the kosher stuff I remember from my friends' bar mitzvahs.",82,8,"Maule Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"4906","Chile","This light to medium weight Cabernet has the right profile, but just doesn't seem to come alive. The nose shows blackberry and tobacco aromas and in the mouth there are dried black cherry and spice notes, but they never shine. A soflty dry, slightly woody finish closes the package.",82,11,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4907","Chile","Strawberry and wet hay aromas give way to a sweet berry-flavored attack, but the wine turns tart and almost shrill on the finish. A green, stemmy sensation lingers in the mouth, along with dark coffee flavors.",82,10,"Casablanca Valley","Merlot",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4908","Chile","A light and tart wine, with a bouquet of berry, tea and a touch of barnyard. On the palate, there's more cherry, tea and oak. The fundamental Pinot characteristics are here, but it turns drying and a bit sour on the finish.",82,7,"Maipo Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4909","Italy","Opulence and intensity set this wine apart and place it high on a list of the world's best sparkling wines. Made with creamy Chardonnay grapes, the brilliant bubbly delivers complexity and harmony thanks to its deep shadings of mature fruit, mineral and yeast. Fabulous.",93,90,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"4910","Austria","Concentrated, firm, touched by caramel, this wine starts out intensely fruity. Then texture, mineral and fruit skins come in to play.

"4911","Chile","Light in color but lively in its aromas of lettuce, half-sour pickle, fresh asparagus and passion fruit. The palate is zesty and jumpy, with lemon-lime flavors, passion fruit and a touch of minerality. And the finish is quite long for Sauvignon, a direct reflection of the wine's heft and 14.5% alcohol.",88,16,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"4912","Italy","What sets this wine apart is the intensity of its aromas: Citrus blossom, creamy lime and honeysuckle are immediate and generous, almost pungent. This showcases many of the prized characteristics associated with the Friuli region of northeastern Italy, which is home to some of the country's most elegant whites. The mouthfeel is rich, refined and silky but there is enough fresh acidity to keep it lively and cool. Pair it with delicate dishes like sea bass or lake fish.",88,22,"Northeastern Italy","Riesling",41.87194,12.56738,3
"4913","New Zealand","A blend of fruit sourced from Canterbury and Marlborough, Giesen's 2005 Riesling is an excellent value in off-dry Riesling.

"4915","France","Peppery and meaty, with stewed plum flavors, this is much more muscular and tannic than Colombo's Côte-Rôtie, yet still lacks the spark seen in his top Cornas bottlings. A bit rustic and wild, but it doesn't seem to have the concentration of fruit to age long term. Drink–2012, with grilled beef.",88,70,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4916","Spain","A little bit leafy and light, but that's traditional Rioja for you. The color is a mix of orange and red, while the palate of snappy red fruits is beginning to slip toward peach and nectarine. If you like a leaner, racier style of wine, then drink this now. It's probably at its peak.",88,30,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4917","France","Firm and tannic, with a slightly worrisome astringency. If this comes into balance, this rating may look a couple points stingy in time.

Imported by VinUS Inc.",90,40,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4921","Italy","Delicate mint and herb shadings back red berry fruit and vanilla-nutmeg spice. There's a creamy almost blueberry muffin dough quality that lends character but is not heavy in the least. Dry firm tannins and a tight, clean close. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",90,60,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"4922","Argentina","Dark purple in color, but more leafy and murky than you'd expect on the nose. The palate has texture and weight, but it's also kind of dull feeling, which matches the wine's chunky, dull flavors. Decent enough, but still too herbal and challenged.",83,14,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4923","France","Developed aromas of fall leaves and straw gainsay this wine's youth. We could wish for a bit more fruit here, but the palate shows a silky texture, some nice intensity and an attractive caramel note. Drink up.",83,30,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"4924","Argentina","Deep and jammy on the nose, and nothing if not potent. But elegance, clarity and sophistication are nowhere to be found as the wine's grapey, soupy, flat character takes over. Bitter on the finish, and throughout there's little to latch onto besides weight and heft.",83,16,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"4925","Chile","Heat, cherry and peppery, herbal aromas get it going, followed by murky, herbal flavors and a hard feel. The finish is quite herbal, and there's more than an accent of tomato. Also a touch bitter. Run-of-the-mill Merlot at best.",83,10,"Central Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"4926","Chile","Aromas of freshly cut lumber, complete with some hints of burning sawdust, are joined by caramel and cassis. Medium to full on the palate, where some sweet fruit and oak flavors make a decent impression. There's a hint of alcohol poking through on the finish, but little else.",81,13,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4927","Chile","This medium weight Chardonnay offered aromas of overripe pineapple and citrus with an odd note somewhere between citrus and varnish. The apple and mild citrus flavors lack vitality, and turn overly tart on the finish.",81,10,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"4928","Chile","A lot of Chilean Cabernets seem to have a distinct weediness to them; this is a perfect example of the style, boasting green hay and herb aromas over subdued—almost stewed—cassis fruit. Some tart acidity keeps things lively on the finish.",81,10,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"4929","France","This lovely wine, a Monopole, is already showing complex, forward fruit with flavors of plum, cherry and cranberry. Soft and fulsome, it shows a light hand with the oak, allowing nuances of tobacco and leather to emerge. Good weight and texture, it seems bound for early glory.",93,65,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4930","France","Another premier cru from Michel Gros, this one not as elegant and fruity as the Réas. Instead it goes for more ripeness, more tannic weight, and a lot more roasted scents from the barrels. Big, rawboned but undeniably appealing, it has a lot of rough-hewn flavor, dominated by toast, tannin and tobacco.",90,65,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4931","France","Scents of graham cracker and malted milk chocolate tickle the nose, while the tart fruit slowly unwinds to reveal cherry and beetroot scents and flavors. Tannic and hard, without immediately showing much sweetness, it seems to put the emphasis on mineral and soil, root and leaf, but may evolve into a very interesting wine.",89,38,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4932","France","The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity. It is tight and tannic, a bit ""lifted"" with the VA, and at this point not showing much fruit or complexity, given the price.",87,65,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"4933","France","Made from young vines, giving fresh, but soft flavors. While the concentration may not be there, this makes a delicious light apéritif style, all fruit and crispness.",88,22,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"4934","Chile","If oak is your thing, this has plenty of it. The nose is heavily toasted and the palate is loaded with cinnamon, nuts and wood spice. But in between the layers of oak there's nectarine, peach and tropical fruit flavors that are of high quality. Drink as soon as possible; the wine is beginning to soften and lose its snap.",88,19,"Pirque","Chardonnay",-33.6793441,-70.5831069,2
"4935","France","Sorbe is one of the leading figures in the two small appellations of Reuilly and Quincy. His Reuilly is honeyed, with fresh mandarin and citrus flavors, leading to a soft, open wine, great as an apéritif.",88,14,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"4936","Spain","Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is. It's always going to be short and stocky, but still it will round into shape as it matures.",88,19,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4937","Chile","Floral and dark, with char and tar adding masculinity to the bouquet. The palate is juicy and balanced, with blackberry as the prime flavor and tobacco and pepper adding nuance. Finishes with a cushy feel and warmth, and overall it sings a nice tune.",88,12,"Colchagua Valley","Malbec",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4938","France","Bottled only three weeks prior to review, this wine may have been suffering a little when it was tasted last May. There's a bit of spice, but the wine just isn't that expressive, showing crisp and tight, with some raw tannins on the finish. Seems to have potential, so hold five years or more before trying.",88,90,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4

"4943","Italy","Our panelists had issues with initial lactic and rhubarb notes but warmed up to the wine as it opened.

"4945","Argentina","Smells strange, like a bowl of Smucker's raspberry jam or applesauce. The palate is creamy and dull, with flat, jammy, candied red fruit flavors that do little to excite. Finishes with a wave of sweet marshmallow and vanilla.",82,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4946","France","A Riesling for those who want the wine to play second fiddle to the food. The palate is quite crisp, almost bitter, despite a hint of sweetness. Try with grilled calamari.",82,18,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"4947","Argentina","Salmon colored, with soapy tangerine and nectarine aromas. The palate is watery and soft, with bland citrus and berry flavors. Comes across like a wine cooler that's lost its fizz.",82,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"4948","France","This Riesling will suit fans of neutral Italian whites. The nose is shy and retiring while the palate is light on its feet, with notes of lemon and wet stones. Bracing acidity, making it a good partner with light fish dishes.",82,22,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"4949","Italy","This wine boasts beautiful purity of aromas, starting with crisp citrus, lime, kiwi and cut grass before evolving to reveal layers of almond blossom and white mineral. A trace of sweetness on the palate is backed by zesty freshness, citrus flavors and overall vigor. This would make an excellent companion to Thai dishes with lemongrass or peanut sauce.",88,39,"Northeastern Italy","Riesling",41.87194,12.56738,3
"4950","Spain","Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries. The palate is lively and acidic, with semisweet red-fruit flavors that are more generic. No reticence here; the wine is racy to the end as it finishes with oak and vanilla.",88,29,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"4951","Chile","Chilcas is a new-to-us label that seems to be on the right path. This Sauvignon is round and melony, with fresh aromas and zesty flavors of grapefruit, kiwi and tangerine. There's even elevated finishing notes of grass and green herbs. Tasty Chilean white for under $10. Grab it and drink that night.",88,9,"Colchagua Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"4952","France","Slightly schizophrenic, this wine touts a strange but intriguing gamut of aromas and flavors. The nose presents mild vegetal and ashy powder notes while the palate offers more typical nuances of nectarine and lemon. A tart and fleeting finish counters the somewhat creamy, medium-full body, concluding with a feeling of balance.",87,17,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"4953","France","The 15th generation of the Clément family to farm in Menetou-Salon, just to the west of Sancerre, makes an elegant Sauvignon Blanc which in its youth shows signs of lees contact and a lightly nutty character over its green fruits.

"4954","France","Starts off with fairly soft aromas of honeydew, petrol and steely minerality. More fruit is showcased on the palate with green apple, lime and pineapple core. Medium weight and appropriately balanced, the finish is fresh and crisp.",87,60,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"4955","France","With a beautiful polished brass color, this is another typically intense offering from Marc Kreydenweiss. A bouquet full of clove, candied apple and honey lead in to the medium-full mouthfeel saturated with dried apricot and sweet spice. The slightly roasty finish complements the structure.",87,69,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"4956","Spain","A little leafy, a little spicy and a little bit of a throwback to the days when Rioja wasn't taken so seriously.

"4959","Argentina","Among the new crop of Patagonian Malbecs, this wine shows a sly style. It's not that full of bells and whistles but it does offer plenty of ripe red fruit such as cassis, cherry and strawberry. Blended in are touches of tobacco and leather. Goes down smooth and easy; registers more lush and ripe than anything. Imported by S&F; Trading Company.",89,13,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

"4963","Italy","Virbrant ruby color with dark berry and a ripe, sweet edge followed by menthol notes. There's a sour and mildly acetic note and powerful, raw tannins that seem very sharp against the wine's medium weight. A nervous wine that could benefit from a few more years in the bottle.

"4965","Spain","Tilts a bit toward the ripe side, with sweet, mature aromas of blueberry, raisin and vanilla.

"4966","Chile","A light coating of toasty, buttery oak creates just the right woodiness, while   the pear, honey and quince flavors are entirely inviting and pleasant.

"4968","New Zealand","A plump, off-dry Riesling, this wine kicks off with scents of passion fruit as well as hints of honey and grapefruit. Honeyed citrus and green apple flavors take over on the palate, finishing long and clean.",87,16,"Marlborough","Riesling",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"4969","France","With its heavy bottle and designer label and name, this must qualify as the most expensive looking vin de pays from the Loire. Somehow the wine, while a pleasant, ripe Sauvignon, doesn't live up to the package. But the price is fine, so enjoy a lively, lightly toasty but still fresh green-fruited wine.",87,14,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"4970","Chile","Given that this wine comes from the Cachapoal Valley, which is warm and normally puts out red wines, this is quite a success. The bouquet is vanilla-tinged and full of apple and nut oil, while the palate blends fresh pear and buttered toast flavors. It's smooth but still fairly fresh, with a richer, somewhat oily mouthfeel that is likely the result of its hotter terroir.",87,15,"Cachapoal Valley","Chardonnay",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,2

"4976","Italy","This is a wine you'll love or you won't. Our panelists came up with a long list of descriptors for the nose: strawberry, rhubarb, pastry crust, smoked bacon fat, resin, rubber and tar.

"4979","Chile","A full nose of charred oak and smoky black cherry is phase one.

"4980","Italy","This wine hits all the right buttons: Its pricing is unbeatable, the packaging is fun with a Paola de Manincor painting on the label and its overall quality is very good. Delicious honey, acacia, polished stone, pink grapefruit and peach are obvious components of an opulent aromatic ensemble. It is lean and racy in the mouth with prominent crispness and good length.

"4982","Australia","With its slightly herbal overtones of oregano, this is a Bordeaux-like   rendition of Cabernet Sauvignon; it's also got the acid and tannic structure to set it apart from stereotypical New World Cabernets.

"4986","France","A good value in Chablis, this bottling from the Boisset group offers steely scents of lime and minerals to go with austere, grapefruity flavors.

"4989","Australia","Feminine on the nose, but a little broad on the palate. Pear and talc notes start things off, with heaps of stone fruit, white pepper and citrus flavors.

"4992","France","From the domaine's young vines, this offering features somewhat restrained aromatics, with just traces of violets and blackberries. But on the palate there's plenty of cassis fruit.

"4994","France","Although there's only about 20% new oak used in this cuvée, it is somewhat apparent on the nose and palate, where cedar, cinnamon and clove take the lead. There's some pretty—some might say Burgundian—fruit, but it's a touch light and herbal.",87,73,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"4995","Spain","Color and size are readily apparent but gaps appear between the layers. For starters, the nose doesn't have the purity and density that it could; and the palate also shows some weakness where structure and quality of fruit meet. Otherwise, it's a ripe and modern red wine with some lushness and depth.",87,65,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"4999","Australia","I like this wine for what it isn't—brash or sweet. Tannins are smooth and manageable, with mushroom and stable notes accenting firm plum and cherry flavors. A little soft on the palate, with a bite of herb at the finish, but it's nearly as enjoyable as the winery's excellent Cabernet.

"5000","Italy","This wine takes its sweet time to open but once it does, you'll get tart cherry, cedar, tobacco, coffee bean, violet and vanilla. Firm, chewy tannins back a bitter note and dusty minerality in the mouth. Imported by Vinifera Imports.",88,74,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"5001","Australia","Light floral and citrus aromas. On the palate, the feel is lively, with overtones of citrus dressing up a steely, minerally core.

"5002","Italy","An Italian classic, Riserva del Fondatore (a brut-style sparkler) offers a compelling nose that is as intense as it is complex. The aromas here span dried fruit and nuts to toast and melted butter. Its appearance is sharp and luminous and the quality of effervescence is both tonic and persistent.",93,90,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"5003","France","A flinty, crisp style, with currants, green apples, pink grapefruit. Initially austere, it opens to some richness. The aftertaste, though, is crisp to a fault.",86,26,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"5004","Chile","Licorice, mint and black plum aromas foreshadow somewhat tart, snappy fruit flavors. The wine has a good mouthfeel but registers a little short on depth of fruit and the sweetness that usually defines South American Malbec. Finishes with some vanilla but also acidic crispness. With 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.",86,12,"Colchagua Valley","Malbec",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"5005","Spain","A nominally sweet red-candy note helps define the upbeat nose, and it all makes sense once you know that there's 20% Garnacha in the wine along with 75% Tempranillo and Mazuelo. With airing you get nice pie cherry and raspberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is juicy and correct. A good wine for pizza or hamburgers. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",86,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5006","Chile","There's a weighty overlay of oak, but the fruit is here and it's fairly balanced and reserved in nature. This is in a softer style with black cherry and sweet plum flavors, and not too much acidity. Drink now.",86,12,"Aconcagua Valley","Merlot",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3
"5007","Australia","Not quite as powerful or intense as the 2002, but still a good drop, the 2003 Steingarten features straightforward lime and wet stone aromas backed by a long, zesty finish.

"5008","Spain","Ready as it will ever be, this mildly baked red starts with minty aromas and chocolate.

Drink now with food and it will satisfy.",86,17,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5009","Australia","From a hilly portion of Western Victoria, this wine is a little softer in style than many other Aussie Rieslings. It still has plenty of lime and wet stone scents, but there's also a slightly confected, bubble-gum-like quality. Drink now.",86,20,"Victoria","Riesling",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"5010","Spain","Racy on the nose, with tea, pepper and pine scents along with basic red-fruit aromas. The palate is zingy and fairly trim, with strawberry and raspberry flavors.

"5011","Chile","With a bouquet of pears and baked fruits, this medium-weight, mildly oaked Chard has what it takes to reel you in. The palate answers the bell with sweet peach and pear flavors, and the finish holds its course. Overall it's a simple, tasty fruitball of a Chard.",86,12,"Curicó Valley","Chardonnay",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,2
"5012","Chile","This medium-bodied Chard leads with healthy oak-based aromas of toast and vanilla, and there's also some warm radiator dust along with baked apple and pear scents. It's a round-styled wine with apple and melon flavors, and the finish yields mostly toast and vanilla. Still alive and kicking courtesy of core acidity.",86,12,"Colchagua Valley","Chardonnay",-34.6761419,-71.097317,2
"5013","Chile","More from the big, friendly school of Syrahs, although a little generic in the final analysis. The bouquet is rich and a touch syrupy, but the palate features a solid core of ripe, deep black fruits. Not perfect but shows plenty of flavor, width, weight and fruit.",86,12,"Aconcagua Valley","Syrah",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3
"5014","Chile","Perfectly good Cab is what you get here. The nose deals some char and leather, but largely it features clean fruit scents. The palate may be a bit short, but along the way the flavors of cassis and berries are commendable. Well done for a value wine.",86,7,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"5015","New Zealand","Pretty standard Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, marrying herbal qualities with hints of honeyed stone fruit.

"5016","Italy","Flavio Riserva Talento is a beautiful expression of northern Italy with fragrant aromas of yellow fruit, toast, roasted nuts and lingering toast. 2003 was a hot and steamy year, but this sparkling wine offers the fresh aromas you should expect from a cool-climate wine zone.",91,42,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"5017","New Zealand","There's a slightly floral, stemmy note to this wine, which accents its bold, almost sweetly fruity nature. Red and black cherries mix on the attack, becoming more spicy and savory toward the back of the palate. Tannins are silky, while the finish picks up hints of mocha. Drink now–2015.",91,65,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"5018","New Zealand","Supple but structured, this is only the third vintage for Felton Road's Cornish Point Pinot and it is really starting to hit its stride.

"5019","Chile","Aromas of roasted coffee, asphalt and pepper give the black cherry, olive and bell pepper scents some character. In the mouth, we find leafy red fruit along with olive flavors, while the texture is juicy and lively. No dead weight or balance issues; but it is a bit green.",86,19,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"5020","France","Stone dust and ripe green apple fill the nose and palate of this easygoing quaff. A pleasing lemon finish balances the intensity and medium weight, making this a nice, solid selection.",86,33,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4

"5022","Chile","From Ventisquero and the Mexican crooner Luis Miguel, this wine has color, heft and size but not a whole lot of finesse or elegance. What it does deliver is rich, basic Cabernet flavors of black cherry and cassis and some toast on the finish. Good but rather regular stuff.",85,15,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"5024","New Zealand","Dry River's 2007 Pinot Noir reveals a slight herbal tinge to its dark fruit aromas and flavors, but it's a nuance that adds complexity and should develop into hints of tea and spice with additional bottle age. As always, it's not overly big or richly textured, but it is concentrated and intense. Drink 2012–2020.",91,90,"Martinborough","Pinot Noir",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3
"5025","New Zealand","Intriguingly floral and savory upfront, this delicate wine then adds a deep base of ripe cherries that expand effortlessly across the palate, giving an impression of fullness without weight, suppleness without being soft. Finishes long, with a great deal of complexity.",91,55,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"5026","Spain","Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",91,59,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5027","Spain","Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",91,80,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5028","Spain","Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.",85,14,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5029","Chile","If you can handle the large-quantity characteristics that govern this wine, particularly olive, herbal notes and vegetal aromas and flavors, then it's pretty nice. For those opposed to traditional Bordeaux-style green notes, it's probably better to upgrade to Santa Rita's richer, riper Medalla Real. Good on the whole but not great; yet at 150,000 cases it's hard to expect better.",85,11,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"5030","France","From the top Monts Damnés vineyard, this crisp light wine has yeasty flavors that hide the fresh grapefruit flavors. There is pleasant acidity at the back, along with some green apple skin. Will be ready by the beginning of 2008.",85,24,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"5031","Spain","Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy. The palate delivers ripe dark fruit flavors but also a touch of medicinality. Balance can be fleeting and this wine doesn't have it all the way.",85,23,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5032","Italy","Harmony and balance are apparent in this elegant, sophisticated sparkling wine from 100% Chardonnay. The wine's aromas include apricot, stone fruit, yellow rose and toasted nut. The perlage is tight and persistent making for a smooth and creamy impression in the mouth.",90,35,"Lombardy","Chardonnay",45.4790671,9.8452433,2
"5033","Italy","This pretty sparkling wine shows many of the characteristics associated with northern Italy: the wine is crisp, fresh and the aromas are brilliantly intact. You'll get notes of roasted almond, peach, apricot and nutty honey. Firm perlage keeps the palate refreshed.",90,40,"Lombardy","Chardonnay",45.4790671,9.8452433,2
"5034","Italy","Here's a delicate and feminine sparkling wine with well dosed aromas of yellow fruit, peach, wildflower and drying mineral. The wine is fresh, tonic and delivers a friendly, cheerful attitude that would work well at cocktail hour.",90,38,"Lombardy","Chardonnay",45.4790671,9.8452433,2
"5035","Italy","An easy wine that will go down nicely with spicy appetizers. Its color is a paler shade of straw and the aromas focus on citrus, lime and stone fruit. The residual sugar is high, making for sweet peach flavors in the mouth.",85,10,"Lombardy","Riesling",45.4790671,9.8452433,3
"5036","France","A fat, full wine, polished by its fresh herbal flavors. There are clean, lime and citrus tastes, a ripe spice and a crisp, green plum aftertaste.",85,15,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"5037","Spain","A standard but solid Tempranillo is what you're looking at. The nose pushes red fruit and some American oak aromas like pickle and dill. The feel is fresh and young, but also a little fleshy and substantive. Finishes friendly and smooth.",85,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5038","Chile","It takes a while for the oak and leather elements to lessen on the nose, and by then the wine has taken on a meaty, reserved, mildly burnt character. It's a woody number with some complexity, namely bitter chocolate that envelops the back palate and finish. Throughout it shows size and intent but never does it fully pull it off. 550 cases made.",85,28,"Casablanca Valley","Syrah",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"5039","Spain","Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.",85,11,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5040","France","Snappy citrus and a crushed stone minerality complement the light, lean structure of the wine. Definitely designed for easy drinking, this would be a deft pairing with fried seafood, having no problem lifting oily textures off your palate.",85,20,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"5041","Spain","Spicy and reedy in an old-fashioned way. This wine represents traditional Riojano winemaking: it's tight, acidic and endowed with racy rhubarb, raspberry and dill flavors. Pretty full and big on the palate, with touches of green herb and spice on the finish.",85,19,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5042","Spain","A potent, concentrated sort of wine with minerally, crusty aromas, smoked meat and black fruit. The palate is deep and ripe, with pure, tasty, sweet flavors of mildly baked blackberry. Generous late, with mocha and toast on the finish. Best now through 2012.",90,36,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5043","Spain","CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",84,60,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5044","Spain","This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas. In the mouth, there's size and power but also a strong medicinal overtone that dampens the fiesta. In the end it's big and fruity but there's no sense of path or purpose.",84,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5045","Chile","Chill it and kill it, and you probably won't be disappointed. There isn't a lot of character to the nose, but the palate offers round melon and citrus flavors supported by pretty good acidity. It's a little sugary but sound and tropical. More than 200,000 cases produced, so it should be widely available.",84,8,"Lontué Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-35.0567954,-71.2688602,3
"5046","Chile","The bouquet blends barnyard and black currants, so in that way it's classic and pretty good. The palate, however, is tangy, short and more “red” in style than the nose leads you to expect. Good freshness and aromas but maybe more tangy and tight than Chilean Syrah should be.",84,9,"Rapel Valley","Syrah",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"5047","Chile","Soft and simple on the nose, with bulk. Size more than substance seems to be the theme here. The palate is a wide load of apple cider and nondescript citrus, while the back end and finish are chunky and lose focus as they rumble along. A forward wine but what's it really aiming to be?",84,15,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"5048","France","Floral notes of rose hips and hibiscus dominate this wine along with essences of petrol and white gumdrop. Off-dry and oily, flavors of sweet stewed peaches and spiced applesauce abound on the palate. Given the weight and viscosity, crisper acidity is needed to liven things up.",84,18,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"5049","Italy","Ferrari's base Brut (with a 2.5-million-bottle production) is a lovely sparkler with yeasty aromas of freshly baked bread and loads of dried fruit, honey and apricot. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy and this impression is reinforced by its foamy perlage.",90,24,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"5050","Italy","This Brut Satèn offers a creamy mouthfeel accented by cheerful tones of yellow fruit, almond and dried apricot. There is crispness here and the tonic bubbles help keep the palate clean for your next sip.",90,39,"Lombardy","Chardonnay",45.4790671,9.8452433,2
"5051","New Zealand","Dry River's Riesling is made in a dry style, with fragrant notes of lime, orange blossom and a hint of tea leaves. It's light without being delicate, bolstered by a slightly dusty texture and a long, intense finish redolent of herbal-leafy elements.",90,45,"Martinborough","Riesling",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3
"5052","Chile","Sort of earthy and heavy, with oak and forest aromas settling onto the nose. The cherry and plum flavors are a touch warm but still satisfying, while the finish is a little choppy but generally pleasant.",84,9,"Maule Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"5053","Spain","Oak, cherry and raisin make for a warm bouquet, and there's initial weight to the palate. But then grabby tannins and cutting acidity take over, pushing the fruit toward zesty, even thin. A light and ready style, for certain.",84,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5054","Chile","A little grapy and heavy, but overall this purple-colored Syrah is good. The bouquet is sweet with plum and prune, and the palate, while a little tangy and young, has vibrant if generic plum and berry flavors. Best if youthful, fruity New World reds are your thing.",84,10,"Aconcagua Valley","Syrah",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3
"5055","France","Vegetal notes and flinty chalk dominate the nose, while essences of green apple and lemon struggle to overcome the intrinsic greenness. The short finish gives no justice to the lush, creamy texture.",84,16,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"5056","Australia","A few years of age have turned this South Australia Chardonnay into a highly nuanced tipple. Kerosene, hay and coconut aromas play off fragrant blood orange scents while the palate offers up toast and caramel in a tight, well-defined structure. Try with grilled salmon or serve on its own.

"5057","New Zealand","NZ Syrahs are often called Rhône-like, but while this one does show some lovely floral and hickory-smoke nuances, it also comes across as slightly raisiny or jammy, with cassis notes that even lean toward being chocolaty. Whatever you think of the aromas and flavors, it's a richly concentrated, velvety textured wine with plenty to recommend it.",89,75,"Martinborough","Syrah",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3
"5058","Chile","Rubbery and drying, with aromas of barrel char and butter that overpower any fruit that might want to escape. Simple plum and cherry flavors work the palate, but they're fading. And the finish is drying and lightly tannic.",83,8,"Aconcagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3

"5060","France","Aromatic and zingy, this off-dry Riesling is easy to like, with aromas of spiced pear, mandarin orange and grapefruit peel that lead into a full-bodied and flavorful palate. There's lemon and toffee in the mouth that fade to a delicious honey and caramel aftertaste. At five years old, this wine has reached its peak and should be enjoyed the next year. Best served on its own.",89,40,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"5061","New Zealand","Although the aromas of this off-dry Riesling are marked by lime and floral notes, there's also an intriguing dark earthiness that imparts gravity and complexity.

"5064","Spain","Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry.

"5066","Spain","An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly.

"5067","Chile","There's a movement in Chile toward the Limari Valley for cooler-climate grapes like Sauvignon Blanc, yet this one hasn't really found its groove. The wine seems a bit soft and distant, with dilute aromas and flavors of peach, melon and apple.

"5068","New Zealand","The 2008 Alana Estate Pinot boasts a perfumed bouquet that includes elements of rose petals and sandalwood to accent savory and black-cherry notes.

"5070","Spain","Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",82,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5071","Spain","An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile. Never really gets it going and seems murky. Two samples tasted.",82,15,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5072","Chile","No matter how much color this has, the basics are at once aggressive and boring. The nose is brambly and lean, a sure indication of limited, tangy flavors that carry some serious herbal character. There's little to this Syrah.",81,8,"Maule Valley","Syrah",-36,-72,3

"5074","New Zealand","At less than one-third the price of Escarpment's single-vineyard wines, this is a great Pinot Noir value.

"5662","Spain","Full and spicy from the get-go, with hints of clove vying with savory berry and leather. The optimum word to describe this wine is friendly, meaning it delivers ripeness, berry flavors and sweet, spicy accents that complete the package.

"5669","New Zealand","From a block in the lower part of the Wairau Valley, this is a pungently herbal expression of Sauvignon Blanc.

"5679","Chile","Tire rubber, tobacco, bacon, olive and a dark smokiness define the nose on this Merlot, which is miles away from the simple, easy wines that most people associate with the variety. This one is big, herbal, peppery and endowed with black fruit, hoisin sauce, roasted tomato and kick. It needs some airing to show its best.",88,24,"Colchagua Valley","Merlot",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3

"5681","Spain","Roasted and rubbery, this features potent leather and compost aromas that settle with airing. Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping.

"5684","Argentina","With the right mix of ripeness and varietal spiciness, this is fruity, dense and earthy, with pepper and herb hints.

An impressive wine.",95,205,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4

"5907","Chile","Lemony and a touch chemical, but for $8 it's more right than wrong. The flavors are citrusy and austere, much like white grapefruit and gooseberry. But the palate has some plumpness, and the finish, while pithy, is honest.",84,8,"Central Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"5908","Chile","Nothing special but probably a better wine and better value than Crucero's Reserva SB. The nose offers matchstick and some hard minerality, while the palate is crisp and tangy but gives smooth edges and reasonably nice citrus and mineral flavors. Highly regular, even for a Central Valley Sauvignon Blanc.",84,10,"Curicó Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"5909","Australia","A terrific example of Australian Chardonnay, the 2003 Tiers offers mature aromas of truffles, orange marmalade and peach preserves. It's full-bodied and rich, yet retains a sense of freshness on the long, anise-tinged finish. Drink now–2012.",93,70,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"5910","Chile","Cool, green, minerally aromas lead it off, and next there's fresh bell pepper, jalapeno and gooseberry flavors. Bright, focused, edgy and stony, with proper acidity, bite and clarity. A good one similar to the winery's Reserva SB, but clearer and more precise.",89,20,"Limarí Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.7462002,-71.0022311,3
"5911","Chile","Emiliana's Natura is a consistently fresh, clean SB. The nose is mildly green and citrusy, with hints of grass, fresh herbs, orange peel and grapefruit. Mineral, lemon, lime and green apple work the flavor profile, while the finish is chiseled and pure. Clean and crisp throughout.",88,11,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3

"5913","Argentina","The jammy, sweet berry aromas are suggestive of blueberry, cookie and graham cracker.

"5915","Chile","Grapefruit and oily mineral aromas are typical of average Chilean SB, while the palate carries a bland citrusy feel and generic flavors of lemon and grapefruit.

"5916","Chile","Early aromas of apple and pear show no oak, but with time more pungent notes of juniper and herbs enter the fray. Juicy in the mouth, with no weight issues, but modest in its delivery of true Chardonnay character. Clean white wine but it doesn't taste like much.",84,9,"Central Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"5917","Chile","The bouquet suggests burnt rubber, compost and briar patch along with basic raspberry/cherry. The palate has a mild creaminess to it and herbal, lightly stemmy flavors of raspberry and rhubarb. Finishes tart, with herbs and vanilla.",83,10,"Central Valley","Pinot Noir",-36,-72,3
"5918","Chile","Nice, friendly aromas feature leafy notes and dry, herbal fruit. The palate is narrow and high in acidity, which pushes the fruit flavors toward raspberry and tart black cherry. Remains lean in scope across the finish, where edgy apple skin flavors take over. Good and honest, but hard and scratchy.",88,72,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"5919","Spain","At first this is lactic and heavy, but later it becomes charred and toasty. Its feel is full, round and fairly smooth, with baked plum, berry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and solid. Good for a 50,000-case production.",86,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5920","France","Because of the extended elevage carried out at Guigal, the company's releases are always behind the market as a whole.

"5921","France","An excellent introduction to the wines of Cornas, this is a gently structured example, but one that shows ample complexity.

Drink now–2020.",90,48,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"5922","Chile","Sulfur and matchstick on the nose is offputting, while what remains suggests oily green fruits.

Doesn't click, really.",83,13,"Curicó Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"5923","Italy","This is a sophisticated and smooth Chardonnay with an extraordinarily soft and silky texture in the mouth.

"5924","Chile","Starts out grapey and big, but soon it finds its focus. The palate is wide and fruity, with balanced tannins and acidity propping up black grape and blackberry flavors. There's some smack to the finish, but the berry flavor is prime and the wine gets better with air. One of Tamaya's best Cabs to date.

"5925","Chile","Common but clean aromas of tea and black cherry give this fuller-bodied Pinot a good start.

"5929","Argentina","A bit leafy and earthy on first take, but this also smells of roasted meat, berry fruit and menthol.

"5931","Australia","If you're looking for a clean, well made Pinot Noir at an affordable price, you could do a lot worse.

"5932","France","From a vineyard planted with almost 7,000 vines per acre, and with low yields (2 bunches) per vine, you would expect concentration. And the wine is hugely perfumed, very aromatic, the fruit flavored with essence of green plum and grapefruit juice. It's the sort of wine that needs at least 3–4 years aging.",93,99,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4

"5934","Chile","Striking and sincere Sauvignon Blanc. One whiff, one taste and one swish across the palate and you'll know that this is elevated stuff. For starters, the bouquet delivers honest bell pepper, melon, passion fruit and apple aromas; and along with the fruit there's nuance, structure and balancing herbal notes. Full, long and regal. Drink now to capture this wine's powerful essence.",91,20,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"5935","Spain","Rubbery and minty on the nose, this wine has cherry and raspberry scents in the background. It feels edgy, tannic and grabby, with roasted berry and a touch of bitterness. Clampy, drying and warm on the finish, it has an herbal edge.",86,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5936","Argentina","Earthy and chunky from the start, this features heavy, granular aromas of blueberry and blackberry. It is huge on the palate but shows little structure or framework to support the heavy berry flavors. Thus, the wine falls flat while tasting sweet and feeling fleshy.",86,25,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

In the mouth, it has crisp cherry tones and bright acidity.",89,22,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"5940","France","Yes, this wine comes from a village of Chardonnay in the Mâcon region of Burgundy. It's a typical, crisp, freshly green Chardonnay that zings on to the palate.

"5941","Austria","A finely constructed wine that is likely to age over many years. With its juicy currant flavors still dominated by minerality and citrus, there is some austerity. It is a complex wine showing great terroir character from the steep vineyard site.",93,67,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"5942","Austria","A botrytized wine that definitely shows honey and ripe fruit, along with the ethereal acidity. The wine is sweet and fresh, the richness only hinted at in the mouth.

"5943","New Zealand","With only 56 cases imported, it may be a challenge to track down some of this full-bodied, slightly chunky Pinot Noir. The oak is a little too evident at this early stage, with toast and vanilla notes laying atop deeper notes of black cherries and spice, but give it 2–3 years and it shouldstart to sing.",91,36,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3

"5945","Chile","Three years running, this wine has been getting better. It shows textbook Elqui aromas of jalapeno peppers and gooseberry, while the flavors are a little tropical due to pineapple notes. On the back end it reverts toward minerally green fruit, jalapeno and white pepper dust. Good wine; not vegetal.",87,11,"Elqui Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.1574117,-70.4969608,3

"5951","New Zealand","This full-bodied Chardonnay certainly isn't shy, offering up smoky aromas tinged with toasted almond and ripe pear, but it also features a refined, tight mouthfeel and plenty of focus.

"5957","Spain","Slightly reduced but still balanced enough to give off a positive early impression. The wine is sweet, almost syrupy, but it's that same ripeness that gives it more oomph and richness than most under-$10 wines.

A good but limited wine that delivers what it should but nothing beyond that.",84,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5959","Spain","A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp.",84,15,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5960","France","Powerful wine, structured with apple skin tannins, layers of ripe, spicy toast and a taut, mineral character.

"5961","New Zealand","This offering continues Saint Clair's recent string of successes—you basically can't go wrong with the Reserve or single-block Sauvignons.

"5978","Australia","A bit unyielding on the nose, then the palate shows rather tight and citrusy flavors.

"5979","Chile","Attractive and very much in the vein of what is really good Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. The bouquet is all about green herbs, cactus pad, passion fruit and citrus. The palate transitions from lemon-lime to tropical pineapple and passion fruit, while the finish is breezy and zesty.

You can really taste those Sangiovese characteristics thanks to lively tones of wild berry, raspberry, blue flower, wild mushroom and subtle spice. That zesty acidity makes the wine perfect for cheesy pasta or lasagna.",88,17,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"5986","Argentina","This smells familiar and solid, with blackberry, licorice and dark cherry aromas. It feels medium bodied for a high-end Argentine Cabernet, with healthy acidity and probing tannins. The flavors of blackberry and raspberry finish crisp and slightly citric.",88,35,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"5987","Argentina","Cola, root beer and cherry aromas come with controlled heat. The palate is dense and chewy, with pumped-up tannins supporting very ripe-tasting cassis and cooked plum flavors. It's toasty and spicy on the firm finish.",88,21,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"5988","France","Young to taste, this wine is hardly ready to show its full fruit and rounded green flavors. Yet it's possible to tell that this is going to be impressively rich but crisp, the acidity a telling adjunct to the perfumed concentration and pear skin flavors.",90,35,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"5989","Argentina","Dark and smoky on the nose, but in a good way, with asphalt and pure blackberry aromas. The wine strikes the palate with immediate grace and power. It's chocolaty yet bright, with toasty oak and vanilla stirring up the finish. A polished and poised wine with a smooth profile.",90,20,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"5990","Austria","A fresh, yeasty nose suggests a young wine. On the palate the white currants and fresh fruit are youthful and juicy, the mineral character only just showing through at the end. The wine needs at least 3–4 years to develop.",90,53,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"5991","Chile","Attractive fern and pine aromas mix with scents of green melon and cactus to create a very likable, true-to-Casablanca bouquet. The palate is agile and balanced, with lively green apple, pineapple and grapefruit flavors. With some tang and kick to the mouthfeel and finish, this sophisticated white ranks up there in terms of value for money.",89,14,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"5992","Chile","Convincing and individual across its aromas, flavors and nuances. Casa Marin is a leader in coastal Sauvignon Blanc, and this full-bodied, racy wine grabs your attention with its crisp, pure personality. It is zesty and alive, with apple and green-fruit flavors, while the focused finish isnarrow and committed. Drink now.",89,25,"San Antonio","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.5922807,-71.6055123,3
"5993","New Zealand","The cherry aromas of this wine are so sweet, so obvious, that they come across as almost candied; thankfully, they're balanced by subtle spice and leather shadings that make it clear that this is wine, not fruit juice. Silky tannins bolster that impression, nicely buffering and extending the finish.",89,39,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"5994","Chile","Dark in color, with ripe black cherry aromas. The palate, however, has a fierce tang that's directly attributable to high acidity, while the palate is a bit tart, spindly and tastes of zesty raspberry and black cherry. Scouring on the finish, with some buttery oak as an offset.",86,20,"Bío Bío Valley","Pinot Noir",-36.9777206,-72.331113,3
"5995","France","A fresh wine, with pure fruit, plum and light cherry flavors and a burst of acidity. The tannins have a firm chewy character but are minor players in this fruity wine. Screwcap.",86,11,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"5996","Chile","Earthy, warm and herbal, with a streak of olive on the nose. The palate has snap and firm tannins, while the flavors are herbal, dry and lean toward raspberry and plum. Finishes very red and dry, with leafy notes.",86,12,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"5997","Spain","This smells mildly grassy and green at first, while balsamic vinegar and tobacco notes enter the frame later on. It's solid and average in mouthfeel, with a slightly sweet and syrupy berry flavor that's tempered by tomato-driven acidity.",85,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5998","Spain","This smells foxy and jumpy, with a candied cherry aroma. Fresh and forward, scratchy and rough, this has raspberry, plum and resiny oak flavors. It breaks down and turns somewhat metallic on the finish.",85,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"5999","Argentina","After whiffs of burnt rubber and char blow off, this berry-packed Cabernet hits like a small brick with black fruit flavor, which packs punch and aftershocks of cocoa and coffee. Chunky, rough and warm.",85,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6000","France","Full bodied and thickly textured, this Southern Rhône Syrah combines cedar and vanilla notes from oak aging with notes of brandied cherries and a bit of asphalt.

"6001","New Zealand","Who would have believed that one day we'd have Sauvignon Blancs paying tribute to 1980s pop groups? At least both share a New Zealand connection. The wine is a bit on the fuller side of things, but nicely balanced by mineral and grapefruit aromas and flavors, ending on notes of lime and cut grass. Drink up.",89,25,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6002","Italy","This Italian Malbec shows bright fruit flavors backed by drying mineral tones and bright cherry tones. The wine has grace and charm thanks to its streamlined build and its natural ability to pair with Mediterranean foods. Aged 12 months in oak, this is the estate's top wine.",89,30,"Northeastern Italy","Malbec",41.87194,12.56738,3
"6003","Italy","This charming Chardonnay-based white (with 10% Viognier) from Tuscany offers both strength and elegance. It sees three months of oak for softness and smoothness but also has pretty floral aromas that fill in the edges. Drink it with pasta or risotto.",89,20,"Tuscany","Chardonnay",43.7710513,11.2486208,2
"6004","Chile","Terrunyo is arguably Chile's best SB. This vintage gets going with a touch of green bean but also plenty of passion fruit and pink grapefruit. The palate is ripe, crystal-clear and tangy, and the passion fruit and citrus flavors really drive it home. Expect a racy wine with dynamic pineapple and grapefruit as its cornerstones.",90,29,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6005","New Zealand","Light in body, yet sinewy in texture and a bit sweet, This Riesling has turned out well. Floral, green apple and lime aromas and flavors are almost Mosel-like, but the wine is richer and weightier than that, clocking in at 10% alcohol.",90,28,"Central Otago","Riesling",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"6006","New Zealand","Roasted cashew or almond butter elements give richness to the aromas, while the medium-bodied palate features crisp flavors of apple, pear and lime, framed by subtle nut and spice shadings. Focused and citrusy on the finish. Certified organic; 56 cases imported.",90,22,"Central Otago","Chardonnay",-44.9566315,169.3988451,2
"6007","Chile","Sort of chunky and melony, with cantaloupe and baby powder on the nose. The palate is fairly weighty, but vital acidity gives it pulse, and the flavors of melon, pineapple and lime are pleasant. Softness on the finish suggests that it won't age very well; drink now.",86,14,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"6008","France","A young, fruity wine that boasts layers of the freshest, bright red berry fruits allied to dusty tannins. It is made to be drunk young, a vivid fruity wine, lively and fresh.",86,12,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"6009","Chile","Mild stony, oceanic aromas blend with controlled bell pepper and jalapeno notes, while the minerally palate is all about citrus fruit, particularly lime. Finishes fresh, racy and clean, but without subtleties or complexity.",86,13,"Limarí Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.7462002,-71.0022311,3
"6010","Argentina","A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has rubbery tannins and candied, foxy-tasting berry flavors. Nothing harsh or sour here, but it is tannic; at best, it's sweet and simple stuff.",84,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6011","France","The wine continues the rise in quality of whites from this producer. It is refined, elegant, not powerful, but with a great balance between wood and fruit, and a long, lingering green fruit aftertaste.",90,34,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6012","New Zealand","Full-bodied and rich, this is an unusually concentrated and intense New Zealand Syrah. Intense aromas of peppery spice, blueberry and cedar add olive and espresso flavors on the palate, framed by some firm tannins. The fruit powers through on the finish, so in a couple of years' time, this rating may look conservative.",90,60,"Hawke's Bay","Syrah",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"6013","New Zealand","Syrah is quickly gaining popularity in Hawke's Bay and this is a good example why. Reminiscent of a Crozes-Hermitage, this wine's meaty, peppery aromas and blackberry-boysenberry fruit aren't overpowering, just nicely balanced and very drinkable over the near term.",90,19,"Hawke's Bay","Syrah",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"6014","New Zealand","From a winery in Matakana on New Zealand's North Island, but made from Marlborough fruit, this is a ripe Sauvignon Blanc filled with tropical notes, hints of honey and peach, yet also a grassy streak that persists through the long finish.",90,13,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6015","France","This is a wine that is about tropical fruits, softness and ripeness. It is definitely full-bodied, needing to show its structure, but the spice, toast and yellow fruit flavors are all immediately attractive.",90,75,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6016","Chile","Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,82,"Apalta","Syrah",-34.5923685,-71.2922047,3
"6017","Chile","Novas is probably more elevated and serious than Emiliana's basic Natura SB, but in the end run it's more or less a similar, high-quality white wine. After an opening that's tight and strained, Novas spreads out to show lime, passion fruit and green melon flavors. The feel is ripe and full, and it finishes grassy and green, with acid-driven length. Drink now for maximum freshness and intensity.",89,17,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6018","Chile","Undurraga's top Sauvignon hails from the premier terroir of Leyda. It smells clean and inviting, with an aromatic mix of talcum powder, lime, mango and scallion. The palate is very fresh and lively, with snappy citrus flavors that include grapefruit. Razor-clean on the finish.",89,22,"Leyda Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,3
"6019","Austria","Hafner has been a pioneer of Austrian ice wine. Not every one in their considerable range of ice wines work. This one does. It has just that right piercing acidity to give a heart-stopping lift to the sweetness of the wine. The sweet pineapple and peach flavors add extra richness.",89,24,"Burgenland","Chardonnay",47.1537165,16.2688797,2
"6020","Australia","Shows classic Chard aromas of melon and peach, amply framed by toasted grain and cereal notes that add texture in the mouth. It's medium to full in body, then develops greater zest and freshness on the long, citrusy finish. Drink now–2012.",89,19,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2
"6021","Chile","Rooty, rubbery aromas of tobacco, cola nut and tree bark cast a friendly shadow over earthy, spicy plum scents. Solid power and body, with roundness and a good mouthfeel. Nothing rugged or out of shape, with dry oak warming the finish. Not complex; easy to drink.",85,13,"Elqui Valley","Syrah",-30.1574117,-70.4969608,3
"6022","Chile","Open-knit aromas of apple, pear, green melon and mineral are perfectly good, while the palate is high in acid and kick. Flavors of grapefruit, generic citrus and grass are solid, as is the finish, which keeps its line. A snappy, alert, easygoing wine.",85,10,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"6023","France","This earthy, light-weight wine has wild strawberry flavor along with citrus-driven acidity that gives the red fruits a taut quality. Tannins and a dry edge suggest it needs a few more months before drinking.",84,26,"Alsace","Pinot Noir",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"6024","Spain","The nose is leathery and mulchy, with earthy berry aromas. It feels raw and choppy, with stalky, leathery, burnt flavors, plus pinches of green and mint. Ultimately it doesn't have much berry power or clarity.",84,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6025","Argentina","There aren't many Argentine Sauvignon Blancs that make a statement, so this is commendable for showing a lightly citric and minerally nose in front of fresh, citrusy flavors of lime, tangerine and grapefruit. More friendly and easygoing than intense or pungent, it fades quick and easy on the finish.",87,16,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6026","France","Shows pleasant Northern Rhône Syrah notes of raspberry and cherry, even if it's not particularly textured or complex. The fruit is crisp and forward, with sufficient tannins to ably partner burgers or steaks. Drink it over the next few years.",87,22,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"6027","France","Fine ripe fruit, with citrus acidity and ripe, soft opulent yellow fruits. The acidity and wood give the wine structure, but the main parts of this wine are its richness and softness.",89,75,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6028","Austria","Finely balanced, but definitely on the floral, perfumed side, this has freshness, white fruits and a crisp, clean texture. It is all easy fruit, dominated by finishing acidity.",89,34,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"6029","Australia","Sure, it's an oaky Chardonnay, but it's an uncommonly well-executed version at a reasonable price. Scents of toast, cinnamon and citrus custard give way to flavors of oranges, stone fruit and toasted grain. It's richly textured and lush in the mouth, showing just a hint of warmth on the finish.",89,17,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"6030","Australia","Full-bodied and broad, this wine offers mouthfilling flavors of peach and citrus tinged with cinnamon and clove. Despite its ample size, it remains mouthwatering on the finish.",89,18,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"6031","New Zealand","A solid effort from the world's first carbon-neutral winery, this starts off a little tarry and rubbery, but that blows off to reveal a dense, rich wine filled with black cherry fruit and ending on roast coffee-bean notes.",89,23,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6032","Chile","Very nicely done for a new brand that we haven't seen before. This is Chilean SB in fine form. It's a mix of green and ripe fruits both on the nose and palate. Aromas of gooseberry and mango are alluring, and in the mouth it bounces along on a wave of bracing acidity. Elegant and easier toprocess than Quintay's more pungent, angular and demanding Reserva.",89,11,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6033","New Zealand","On the herbal-vegetal side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, but manages to balance those elements with red pepper and nectarine flavors in a plump, easygoing style. Served with a cold vegetable terrine, this would be very stylish. Drink now.",88,18,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6034","New Zealand","A strong effort from Shepherd's Ridge, showing decent complexity—cola, wintergreen, plum, smoke and coffee notes—ample structure and a mouthwatering finish. This is the rare Marlborough Pinot than can match with red meat, like lamb chops or venison—many are just too soft.",88,20,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6035","Chile","No getting around the fact that this wine is raisiny but not that ripe in the middle. The nose suggests deep fruit, with blackberry, prune and other black fruit aromas. But while the palate starts with cassis and berry flavors, it has green flavors in the center and on the finish that cannot be ignored.",85,16,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6036","Chile","Slightly green and candied on the nose, but also showing vanilla and sweet cotton candy aromas. The palate is zesty and kind of jumpy, with wiry berry flavors in front of a hard finish. Has qualities but not a harmonious wine.",85,13,"Limarí Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.7462002,-71.0022311,3
"6037","France","A wine that seems to have come from over-ripe fruit, with an awkward juicy character piercing the dry tannins. Acidity is there over the blackberry fruits.",85,17,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"6038","Chile","Neutral smelling except for some pear and mild apple, while the palate is tangy and linear, with citrus, lemon and green apple flavors. Clangy and ringy on the finish, but solid all around. Drink soon or wait for the upcoming vintage.",85,11,"Limarí Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.7462002,-71.0022311,3
"6039","Australia","A tart, hard-edged rendition of Clare Valley Shiraz, from the cool subsection known as Polish Hill better known for its Rieslings. Tart plum and berry flavors are touched with spice, vanilla and traces of hickory smoke and bacon fat. The appealing aromatics are the wine's best facet. Try aging it through 2015 and see if it improves.",85,26,"South Australia","Syrah",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6040","Italy","Enhanced with tiny percentages of Merlot and Canaiolo, this Sangiovese-dominant wine shows sweet cherry and blueberry aromas, with pretty accents of exotic spice and toasted almond. Pair this with fried chicken or cotoletta alla Milanese.",87,14,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6041","Chile","Pleasant and melony on the nose, without the sharp, piercing aromas that sometimes push Chilean SB over the edge. New from the north of Chile, Elki is medium-bodied and generous, but not too angular. It's a whole wine with common citrus flavors as opposed to something demanding and sharp.Drink right away.",88,15,"Elqui Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.1574117,-70.4969608,3

"6043","New Zealand","Shows the mushroomy, earthier side of New Zealand Pinot Noir, but does it very well, backing up those flavors with plenty of weight and intensity as well as cola-tinged dark fruit. Ends with some slightly coarse tannins, so put it away for a couple of years, or serve with a charred dry-aged steak.",88,40,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"6044","France","Initially very mineral, this wine opens up to soft, creamy toast and vanilla flavors. The acidity is crisp but sweet, hinting at yellow fruits and then showing off pears. The finish is all about freshness.",89,39,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6045","New Zealand","This seems to take a page out of Australia's Clare Valley Riesling style book, offering floral notes, green apple and citrus aromas and a reasonably dry, muscular style. Lime sherbet flavors dominate, finishing crisp and tart.",89,18,"Marlborough","Riesling",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6046","France","Initially, this appears gentle and creamy; only later does acidity and green pear skin structure come in. Full and plump, with soft white fruits, the wood is prominent at this stage.",89,24,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6047","New Zealand","This is an attractively ripe Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with bold aromas and flavors of gooseberries and nectarine, rounded out even further by touches of fig. It's medium-bodied and nicely balanced, combining grapefruit and mineral notes on the long finish.",89,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6048","France","A soft, unfocussed wine that certainly shows the black color of Malbec, from which comes the name of the wine. But it lacks definition, the wood element separate from the ripe berry fruits, with acidity trailing behind.",84,11,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"6049","Chile","Concentrated and sweet, with medicinal aromas, a lot of color and burnt characteristics. The palate is big and acidic, with jumpy plum, berry and candied flavors. Short and stunted on the finish, and seemingly roasted. A step down from the previous vintage.",84,14,"Colchagua Valley","Syrah",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"6050","Chile","A low-intensity wine with dull apricot aromas and mild oxidization. Riesling is the base grape, but the wine is mildy Sherried and honeyed, with burnt orange as the lead flavor. Heavy orange and apricot flavors weigh down the short finish.",84,25,"Curicó Valley","Riesling",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"6051","Spain","Generic red fruit and milk chocolate aromas precede a tangy palate with a fairly high acid-to-body ratio. This tastes of tart red plum, with a hint of chocolate; it's short, crisp and quaffable. Novo Imports and Aidil Wines & Liquors.",83,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6052","Spain","Dry berry, leather and spice aromas lead to a juicy, high-acid palate, with red cherry, tart plum and pepper accents. It remains zesty, clean, simple and sharp on the finish.",83,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6053","Argentina","This has a saturated purple color, with aromas that are green, inky and grassy. Supertannic and drawing in feel, it has black fruit and chocolate flavors that come across pushy, sweet and hot. It's as bold as they come, but it lacks elegance and harmony.",83,28,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6054","Spain","Tobacco, brown sugar, dried fruit and vanilla aromas work the bouquet, which is very nice. In the mouth, however, it's acidic, almost to the point of being citrusy. Flavors of earthy sour plum and raspberry are propped up by lasting acids, while the palate teeters on lemony and shear. Drink now.",87,110,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6055","Chile","Bang! One sniff of this wine and you are floating in those distinct, semisharp aromas that are Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. There's sea air, nettle and citrus galore, and then flavors of gooseberry, green fruit and grapefruit. It's fresh and forward, with angularity and strong varietal character.",88,14,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6056","Australia","Shaw and Smith's Sauvignon Blanc has become emblematic of the Adelaide Hills style, combining tropical fruit with a grassy streak, all framed by zippy citrus flavors. This would work equally as an apéritif or with various seafood dishes.",88,25,"South Australia","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6057","France","An attractively balanced wine, full of ripe, warm fruit, but still keeping the acidity as a counterweight to the rich tropical and white fruit flavors. The wood shows, but the fruit powers through to give richness and some freshness.",89,38,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

"6059","New Zealand","This pioneering Otago winery has turned out a medium-bodied, sturdily built Riesling loaded with notes of baked apples and spice.

"6060","Chile","Smoky, smooth and deep, with a notch or two of complexity on its belt.

Adequate length and chewy, manageable tannins make the finish a solid final chapter.",88,25,"Colchagua Valley","Merlot",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3

"6063","Chile","Robust and stemmy, with soupy, herbal aromas that lean toward mint and tomato. The acidity is high, and thus the raspberry/red cherry flavors are lean and tart, as is the finish. Rather sour and leafy; an underachiever.",83,13,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6064","Argentina","Oily and salinic in aroma, this wine smells like an oyster shell. It feels plump and soft, without much acidity. Honey, banana and mealy flavors rest on the finish of this organic Chardonnay.",82,18,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"6065","Argentina","Fiery, hard and closed on the nose, this has a chemical hint. It feels acidic and sappy, with a weird mix of flavors that run from fish and fake butter to earthy, leathery raspberry. Stalky on the finish.",82,29,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6066","Spain","Plastic and lemon aromas are neither exciting nor inviting. This feels flat and tastes bland and jammy, with mossy berry aromas.",82,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"6068","Argentina","At first, this smells charred and meaty, but blackberry, leather and roasted plum aromas soon sneak out. This runs big, with good acidity and manageable tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are lively and familiar.",87,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6069","Spain","This smells bullish and chunky, with a lively, acid-driven palate that boasts cherry, dark plum and cocoa flavors. It feels drawing and full of vitality, so serve this with food or allow it to breathe.",87,14,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6070","France","Light, fresh, soft and already very drinkable. The initial taste is dominated by citrus, and then it rounds out, adding toast, green fruits and a definite sophistication for a simple white Burgundy.",88,59,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6071","Austria","A lovely, lively, brittle wine, its delicate fruit flavors featherlight over the palate. The structure is here, but the acidity and the green, perfumed fruits are more dominant. The aftertaste is bright and fresh.",88,40,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"6072","New Zealand","For all of this wine's 14.5% alcohol, it's not that rich, instead presenting a medium-bodied, elegant palate feel. Hints of violets and cracked pepper are attractive on the nose, easily marrying with the wine's flavors of black olive, meat, sour plum and slightly pruny notes. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",88,60,"Hawke's Bay","Syrah",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"6073","Chile","Minty and dusty at first, with secondary floral aromas that make you take notice. The palate is juicy and jumpy, with sizable coconut and black raspberry flavors that indicate ripeness but also some heavy oak aging. Shows grip and a touch of fire on the medium-long finish. Only 250 cases produced.",88,20,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"6074","Austria","Very rich, as you might expect from botrytised Chardonnay. It remains surprisingly young, no sign of 11 years' aging, with the acidity coming through freshly over the maple syrup and baked apple flavors. The finish brings the acidity right up front.",88,55,"Burgenland","Chardonnay",47.1537165,16.2688797,2
"6075","Italy","Torre Pieve is a thick and creamy Chardonnay that is half aged in oak and half in stainless steel. These two methods give the wine structure and softness, but they also allow for the wine's natural fragrances to stay intact.",88,30,"Veneto","Chardonnay",45.4414662,12.3152595,2
"6076","New Zealand","A nice Pinot at a nice price, kicking off with lifted cherry fruit and a tinge of minty greenness. It's medium in body, with delicate and supple tannins framing clean, fresh cherry flavors. Finishes soft, easy and with decent length and intensity, making it a pleasant quaff for spring and into summer.",88,20,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6077","Chile","Has its good points but also exhibits detectable vegetal notes of asparagus and especially canned green beans on both the nose and finish. In between, there's mealy corn, sweet apple and mango flavors. Not a disaster but not as fruity and clean as need be.",83,15,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6078","Chile","Melony and sweet smelling, with sticky, strange flavors of chewing gum, melon and pickled citrus rind. Finishes weird, too. Overall, Indomita's wines are outside the lines and hard to enjoy.",82,15,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"6079","Argentina","This wine's finest quality is its white flower fragrance. It feels thick like fruit juice, with plodding lemon-lime, pineapple and banana flavors. Fruity but cloying on the finish.",82,12,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"6080","Italy","Here's a no-fuss Cabernet Sauvignon from Tuscany that delivers layers of black cherry, spice, leather and dried tobacco. The intensity is measured and the mouthfeel is medium in intensity, but the general ease and approach is what sets this wine apart.",87,15,"Tuscany","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6081","France","Very grassy, herbaceous aromas lead to a wine that is dominated by minerality and pink grapefruit. It is intense, ripe and concentrated, but there is an element of tension in its crisp aftertaste.",88,25,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6082","Argentina","Solid, sweet-styled Cab, this starts out with dark, piercing berry and asphalt aromas, which are followed by an appealing blast of dark-fruit flavors. Turns more aggressive and rugged as it opens, but stays the course.",88,18,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6083","New Zealand","This winery hasn't fared all that well in recent vintages, but hopefully the 2007 represents a step in the right direction. The overly pungent, grassy notes have been replaced by riper, more balanced fruit that calls to mind honey, melon and fig yet finishes dry and minerally. A bit tarry and rubbery when first opened, so a quick decant is recommended.",88,19,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6084","New Zealand","A loud style of Chardonnay, with smoky oak aromas wrapped around a core of yellow plum and grilled peach. It's medium-bodied, but with plenty of intense flavor—a bold wine that satisfies rather than charms.",87,18,"Marlborough","Chardonnay",-41.57269,173.4216613,2
"6085","New Zealand","A nice effort at a nice price, the 2007 Piko Pinot Noir captures that elusive supple, silky mouthfeel of Pinot, then adds black cherry fruit, touches of mushroomy complexity and hints of vanilla and cinnamon. A delicate but strong herbal note adds a sinewy core. Drink now–2012.",88,18,"South Island","Pinot Noir",-45.1526707,169.8926333,3
"6086","Chile","Vanilla, pear and a whiff of wintergreen make the nose intriguing, but after that it's commercial mango and pineapple flavors with a pithy finish. A sweet, overpumped Chardonnay.",82,9,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"6087","Chile","Apple juice aromas don't hold it together for long, and the palate is spritzy and acidic. Apple cider and a touch of vinegar and citrus are the flavors. Not the type of Chardonnay we can recommend.",81,9,"Molina","Chardonnay",-35.1164987,-71.2829759,2
"6088","Argentina","This wine isn't flawed, but it has a faded waxy banana quality. It tastes, smells and feels creamy and confected.",80,18,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"6089","Argentina","This smells of generic red fruit and pasty oak, and it tastes burnt, slightly chemical and rubbery, with creamy berry fruit flavors taking over.",80,10,"Mendoza Province","Merlot",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6090","Italy","Executed in a streamlined and traditional fashion, this ruby-colored wine shows tart acidity and bright fruit flavors of wild berry and blueberry. Medium bodied, this would pair beautifully with lamb or pork chops.",87,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6091","Italy","This Sangiovese from central Italy offers abundant freshness and pretty aromas of wild berry, almond, cola and dried ginger. There's a touch of dried herb and licorice that gives the wine a bright, buoyant finish.",87,17,"Central Italy","Sangiovese",41.87194,12.56738,3
"6092","New Zealand","Starts off with minerally hints of stone dust and melon, then develops ripe red currant and fig flavors on the full-bodied palate. Falls off a bit quickly on the finish, but it's a decent wine at a reasonable price.",87,13,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6093","Argentina","This plump, ripe Malbec is aggressive and jumpy on the nose, but the flavors of blackberries and chocolate are pure and positively represent what Argentina can do with value-priced Malbec. If you're not expecting miracles, this thick, textured wine may just win you over.",87,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6094","New Zealand","Pretty standard in terms of flavor profile, but well-executed, marrying toasty, pain grille aromas with flavors of vanilla, ripe pears and melon. Medium- to full-bodied, it finishes with a flourish of oak and spice.",87,20,"Martinborough","Chardonnay",-41.2190932,175.4600651,2

"6097","Spain","Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.",95,167,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6098","France","This is an impressively rich nonvintage selection, with tropical fruit as well as a mineral-driven character. It's impressive and would certainly take more bottle aging.",94,44,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"6099","Italy","Toasted almond, wild berry, plump cherry and wild raspberry open the nose on this Sangiovese, which has the varietal's characteristic freshness as well.",86,11,"Central Italy","Sangiovese",41.87194,12.56738,3
"6100","Spain","Standard berry aromas show touches of raisin and earth, but not too much of either. It feels fresh, crisp and alert, with cherry tomato, berry fruit, tobacco and vanilla flavors. This feels healthy but not real deep or complex on the finish.",86,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6101","Argentina","A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.",87,40,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"6102","Austria","The vines, rare in the Wachau, were planted because the family liked to drink Sauvignon Blanc, a simple explanation for a wine that is fresh, green and balanced between herbaceousness and tropical fruit flavors.",87,65,"Wachau","Sauvignon Blanc",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"6103","Argentina","Berry and earth on the nose are welcoming aromas, and overall this juicy, simple Malbec offers clean lines, a touch of complexity and good balance. The flavors channel berry and plum, and some vanilla runs shotgun. Not overripe or off base.",87,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6104","Argentina","Lots of heavily toasted oak sits atop the bouquet, and thus it's no surprise that the flavor profile runs a bit lemony and sharp. But give the wine time to unfold and you'll find a layer of pure blackberry mixed with notes of chocolate and coffee. Arguably too oaky but with good core qualities.",87,18,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6105","Australia","There's a touch of wood to this wine, but the primary emphasis is on citrusy, pineapple-scented fruit. Apple flavors provide roundness, while the wine finishes citrusy and fresh without being sharp.",87,12,"Australia Other","Chardonnay",-25.274398,133.775136,2
"6106","Italy","Made with organically grown Chardonnay from the mountainous Dolomites region of Italy and closed with an innovative glass cork, this is a beautifully aromatic white wine with intensely fragrant notes of acacia flower, melon, peach blossom, honey and Golden Delicious apple. It has a creamy, viscous body and fresh acidity with a floral aftertaste. It is, however, very sweet-tasting: Pair it with foods that will contrast that sweetness such as spicy Thai or Vietnamese.",87,19,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"6107","Argentina","This mighty Malbec opens with toasty oak, a pinch of sawdust and perfumed black fruit, vanilla and spice notes. The palate is lofty and rich, with beautiful berry and plum flavors. A smooth, sexy wine from the Uco Valley that shows that vineyard sourcing absolutely matters. Best wine from Alta Vista to date.",94,50,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6108","Chile","This is as stout as they come, with excellent depth, structure and pulse, all of which make it a prime cellar candidate. It shows balsamic aromas of cedar, spiced berry and earth. The mouthfeel is ripe and smooth, with grip and power held in reserve. It tastes of chocolaty berry fruit and savory herb, and it's warm and roasted on the finish. Drink from 2013–2018.",93,65,"Curicó Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3

"6110","Argentina","Penetrating cola, mint and black fruit aromas are probing. It feels tight and gripping, tasting forward and correct for the variety, with bell pepper, black fruit and spice flavors. This is robust, with good flavors and quality fruit.",86,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"6112","New Zealand","This is a supple, medium-bodied red wine that shows none of the green flavors that often mark Hawke's Bay reds.

"6115","Argentina","Still the king of South American Pinot Noir, Chacra's “55” offers a beautiful amalgam of dusty Middle Eastern spice aromas along with raspberry, cherry and cocoa notes. It's a finessed but forceful (read: high-alcohol) Pinot with penetrating black cherry, plum and chocolate flavors, and the finish is long but hot in its youth. Doesn't lack for much of anything. Best from late 2010 through 2013.",93,125,"Other","Pinot Noir",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"6116","Argentina","Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas.

Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region.",93,47,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6117","France","This is Pehu-Simonet's contrast with its Blanc de Noirs from the Montagne de Reims. It has the same dryness as that wine, but it features a more open character. There is, of course, minerality imparted from the chalk soil, which is balanced deliciously with an intense citrus flavor. Age for another year in bottle.",93,72,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"6118","Argentina","Little by little Trapiche is improving its Pinot Noirs, evidenced by this authentic, lightly perfumed wine. It's fresh, bearing good acidity and roasted berry and leaf flavors. It finishes with mild tomato and herb accents. This gets better with time in the glass.",86,15,"Mendoza Province","Pinot Noir",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6119","New Zealand","A rare disappointment from Saint Clair—and it's still a good wine, just not up the standards set by the winery's other reserve wines. Ripe, peachy fruit is not so much framed by oak as covered by it, starting and finishing with layers of buttered toast and vanilla.",86,27,"Marlborough","Chardonnay",-41.57269,173.4216613,2

"6121","Chile","Grassy and green-smelling, with hints of asparagus, green tobacco and sea air. This is true cool-climate white wine, and it shows its proximity to the ocean via aromas of green bean, asparagus and citrus. It's lean as can be, and tight as a drum. It's a terroir wine that has good freshness but could benefit from slightly more amplified fruit.",86,20,"Limarí Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.7462002,-71.0022311,3
"6122","Argentina","With a hint of prune to the nose and some cheesy oak, the red flags go up. But in the mouth, the wine shows good berry and cassis flavors and admirable depth and length. Finishing notes of cassis and blackberry give it a good send-off. By no means exceptional but by all means a likable though slightly generic Cabernet.",86,11,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6123","Argentina","A well-oaked wine with some modern touches. It's ripe and ready but not overdone; the flavors are of raspberry and light resin, but not much else.

It's good and inoffensive, but it doesn't make you take notice.",86,18,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6124","Spain","Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola.

Drink now through 2014.",93,62,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6125","Spain","Protos is a flagship Ribera del Duero property and its wines have been on the rise lately. This is ripe and spicy, with black fruit and then a twitch of prune and moss on the nose. It's racy, pure, forward and stout, with a mix of red and black fruit flavors. Warm and integrated on the finish. Drink now through 2013.",92,45,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"6127","Spain","This smells nice and rooty, and also a bit like strawberry jam. It feels steely, zesty, juicy and almost too acidic, with blazing red plum and pie cherry flavors that are offset by integrated, spicy oak. It's dry and tangy on the finish.",86,24,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6128","Argentina","This is dark, smoky and minty at first, turning more earthy, leathery and warm as it opens.

"6176","Argentina","Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak.

"6188","Argentina","Far less ripe and appealing than the 2004 version. The '05 comes out of the chute smelling malty and lactic; airing reveals strawberry milk notes, while the flavors struggle to express themselves.

"6195","Chile","A ton of oak aromas hit with force: there's butterscotch, mocha and caramel leading the pack.

Best to drink soon.",86,14,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"6209","France","A rich, juicy, super-ripe wine, the fruit a powerhouse of dark flavors.

It is still young, and needs 2–3 years.",89,10,"Southwest France","Malbec",46.227638,2.213749,4
"6210","Argentina","Opens with warm, woody aromas that fold in molasses and maple along with mildly baked berry fruit.

But there's also a briny, pickled accent to the nose and accents of olive, rhubarb and herbaceousness. Interesting in that it differs greatly from Alta Vista's Temis.",88,50,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6226","Argentina","From 83-year-old vines, this is an opaque wine with pastry/graham cracker aromas and a little bit of leather and funk. The palate has hard-hitting, cheek-slapping tannins and dense but herbal plum, blackberry and salinic flavors. It's not elegant or sleek, but it is big, thick and makes its point.",88,19,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6227","Argentina","Most of the Toso wines are screaming successes, but this Syrah is mostly an amalgamation of extract and lots of oak. The wine smells like blackberry syrup caked with mocha, while the flavors and feel are limited except for the barrel notes. As Syrah goes, this doesn't deliver much finesse; just weight and wood.",83,36,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6228","Chile","A tart and sharp-edged Cabernet from Maipo? That's pretty much what this punchy, citrusy wine amounts to. It's clean but angular, with sharper than normal acidity pushing lean, peppery, red-fruit flavors. Much more zesty and tangy than you'd expect.",83,12,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"6230","Chile","A demanding, pushy wine with few rewards. The nose is aggressive with aromas of shoe polish, coffee and gamy fruit, and the palate turns jumpy and more acidic as it opens. Rough and tumble, yet concentrated. Imported by Orvino Imports.",82,13,"Molina","Merlot",-35.1164987,-71.2829759,3
"6231","France","This is a ripe, rich and full-bodied selection that has a flavor of spiced pear. It has weight and intensity, a wine that is on the sweeter side of brut, although this character is finely integrated. The finish brings out delicious acidity.",90,110,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4

"6233","Australia","The grapes are partially severed from the vine, then left to dry prior to harvest.

"6234","Chile","Buttercup aromas give a sense that this wine is right on the edge. And it probably is; it's an '06 with ripe, soft, melony flavors and lots of pineapple and mango on the finish. Big and fruity now, but it's not going to last much longer.",85,10,"Maule Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"6235","Chile","A bit of brambly sharpness guards the bouquet, but digging will get you to raspberry and plum aromas.

"6236","Argentina","Clean, straightforward aromas of berry, cassis and mineral are nice, while the palate has ample lushness, purity and focus.

"6237","Argentina","Fresh, inviting raspberry, strawberry and tempered vanilla aromas set up a snappy, equally fresh palate of cherry and raspberry.

Well made and likely good with food.",88,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"6241","France","By not adding sulfur to the wine, André and Michel Drappier have managed to produce a wine with greater depth than most, perhaps compounded by the slight oxidation that gives richness. It's a food wine, dry and packed with baked apple flavor, finishing on a high note of acidity. Disgorged March 2012.",90,52,"Champagne","Pinot Noir",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"6242","France","Light as a feather, this is delightful and fragrant. Its fruits are refreshing, with crisp pear and melon flavors that accompany its ripe acidity. The wine dances on the palate, it's a great apéritif with a slightly sweet finish.",90,59,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"6243","Chile","This heady Cabernet features aromas of baked fruit blended with char.

"6245","Argentina","The 2008 Noemía wines all seem a little sedate and short compared to prior years. This wine is dark, crusty and tarry on the nose, with requisite black fruit and a slightly soupy quality. The palate is full and chewy, with medium-intensity black fruit and chocolate flavors. Finishes short, without much velocity.",88,45,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"6246","Spain","Quite rustic smelling, with hickory smoke, barbecue sauce, spice and cola aromas. Like most Cigales wines, it has a firm tannic bite and a grating mouthfeel.

"6247","Australia","Citrusy and perfumed, with a bit of tomato-leaf herbalness thrown into the mix, this is a light, rainwater-fresh style of Sauvignon Blanc that needs more concentration and intensity before it can be considered top-flight. It's a workmanlike effort, but nothing more.",85,19,"Victoria","Sauvignon Blanc",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3

"6251","Italy","Galatrona is one of Italy's top Merlots and 2004 is its best vintage yet.

"6252","Spain","Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",96,303,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6253","Spain","Really good and interesting Syrah, with chocolate, campfire, menthol and prune on the nose. With airing the wine quickly settles into a deep, smooth berry and chocolate groove, while the finish deals pure tannins and comfort. Ripe but not raisiny; a really nice example of Jumilla Syrah, with 4% Viognier blended in for lightness (and it still weighs in at 14.9%).",90,23,"Levante","Syrah",37.8945909,-4.7549218,1
"6254","Argentina","An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end.

"6255","Spain","Firm, earthy and rubbery aromas lead to a tight, focused palate with robust black cherry in the lead and black tea and coffee notes along the side.

"6260","Italy","Made from a clonal selection of the estate's best Cabernet Sauvignon, this cheerful red is concentrated and extracted with a seductively sweet-smelling nose. It is by no means simple: Background aromas of tar, root beer, espresso, chopped mint and bright berry speak to its Tuscan roots.

"6271","Spain","Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity.

"6305","Austria","Willi Bründlmayer uses the lyre canopy, open in the center like the ancient lyre of classical times, in part of the Heiligenstein vineyard. This, he believes, gives greater exposure, and therefore heat, for the grapes. Certainly this beautiful wine is richer than the other Bründlmayer Riesling from the same vineyard.

"6307","Spain","Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking.

"6309","Spain","Bursting, powerful Cabernet from Jumilla is not an everyday event, so keep an eye out for this dark, sweet blackberry- and chocolate-driven youngster that only saw a few months in oak.

"6310","Spain","An improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight.

"6314","Argentina","Argentino is a Malbec made from two vineyards: Adrianna in Tupungato and Nicasia in Vista Flores/Altamira.

"6381","Argentina","Fairly round aromas of blackberry are also slightly grapey, while the plump palate offers dark fruit flavors and a choppy mouthfeel. Finishes with a taste of powdered drink mix and grape bubblegum. Decent but shows all the signs of the large-production, commercial wine that it is.",84,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6382","Austria","This wine's elegant, ripe, grapefruit and tropical fruits are concentrated and suggest 2–3 years aging. Its lively acidity, layered with green apple skin tannins and richness, gives the true pungency of Sauvignon Blanc.",90,29,"Südoststeiermark","Sauvignon Blanc",46.8885229,15.8936247,3
"6383","Austria","Bone dry, deliciously crisp, this young Riesling exudes minerality, steel and flint while giving flavors of green apple, grapefruit and white currant. It shows great acidity in its tight, taut finish.",90,38,"Kamptal","Riesling",48.585085,15.4126618,3
"6384","Chile","This opens with an oily note that's soon replaced by generic white peach and apple scents. It feels plump, with chunky flavors of citrus, kiwi and lime, and it's mild yet fairly long on the tail end.",87,13,"Elqui Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.1574117,-70.4969608,3
"6385","France","From the cool Limoux region of Languedoc, this is almost Burgundian in its tannins and fresh acidity. Perhaps the juiciness is a little simple, but there are great wild strawberry fruit flavors.",86,13,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Pinot Noir",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6386","Spain","Citrus, barrel spice and vanilla are the primary aromas on this fresh, slightly watery Chard from Catalonia. The palate is dominated by pineapple and green apple flavors, while the tail end is clean and quiet.",86,13,"Catalonia","Chardonnay",41.5911589,1.5208624,2
"6387","France","The steep south-facing Chêne Marchand vineyard provides fruit for this very concentrated and impressive wine. Its weight doesn't come from richness, but rather a powerful structure that underpins a mineral tang and intense freshness.",92,42,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6388","France","The Romans made it to Sancerre, hence the name of this wine. The flavors are rich, with a mineral edge to the notes of green fruits, plums and greengages and a serious citrus core. With its structure, the wine needs to age for 2–3 years.",92,25,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6389","Italy","Here is an organic Merlot with well-integrated spice, fresh fruit nuances and natural rubber (a tiny touch of Band-Aid is present as well). Soft tannins and a velvety mouthfeel give the wine a sophisticated edge, and its dusty tannins give it the structure to stand up to grilled meat.",89,35,"Tuscany","Merlot",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6390","Italy","Sonoro is a pure expression of Merlot. This vintage was particularly good to the soft, cherry-scented grape variety, and in fact, this pleasant wine delivers lush notes of thick, ripe red fruit and chocolate. For now, the wine is still vibrant and racy, but may not age well.",89,50,"Tuscany","Merlot",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6391","Spain","Ysios is a ripe, smooth wine with polished aromas of black fruit, charred meat and vanilla. The palate has black cherry, plum, bacon and chocolate flavors, and the finish is smoky. Throughout there's a nice grilled character to the wine, which isn't very complicated and isn't likely to improve much with age. Drink now through 2010.",89,30,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6392","Argentina","Not as clean and fresh on the nose as it could be; instead pickle and barnyard notes enter the picture. It's better on the palate, which is sweet and sticky as it delivers chunky berry fruit flavors. Sort of cloying on the finish.",84,18,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6393","Argentina","Fairly jumpy and foxy on the nose, but underneath you'll find zippy red fruit and gumball sweetness. The palate has a syrupy feel with decent tannins and a pedestrian structure. Tastes sweet, ripe and candied, with mild raisin on the finish.",84,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6394","France","Proper Nuits-St.-Georges, all dry tannins powering through the dark cherry fruit flavors, and balanced with tasty acidity. There's great potential here, the ripe fruits just showing their intensity, but for the moment, the tannins are the core.",90,73,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6395","France","Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot. There is some bitterness from the extraction, but the wine needs many years before it comes into balance—the juicy red fruit finish promises richness later.",90,240,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6396","Austria","An elegant but rich wine, the green acidity in good balance with the rounded tropical fruit flavors. There is a proper crisp element to this fine wine, its white fruits offering richness to the bone dry aftertaste. Glass stopper.",90,27,"Kamptal","Riesling",48.585085,15.4126618,3
"6397","Austria","An unfinished masterpiece, still dominated by youthful yeasty flavors, ripe with white peaches, pears and a crisp pink grapefruit element. The wine has minerality, but the juiciness is still to happen. Three to 4 years at least.",90,46,"Kamptal","Riesling",48.585085,15.4126618,3
"6398","Chile","Like the winery's 2010 Corralillo Syrah, this comes across funky, more herbal and pointed than in prior years. The body is full but hard, with roasted berry, spice and herb flavors. It feels forced and a bit warm, with a salty note and juicy, almost sharp acids.",87,43,"San Antonio","Syrah",-33.5922807,-71.6055123,3
"6399","Chile","This wine's black cherry and spice aromas are clean and inviting. Despite angular acidity, it feels fresh, while the palate deals a mix of dark fruit, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. The finish is herbal and slightly briny.",87,11,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6400","Spain","Fits the mold of traditional Rioja Crianza. The nose has oaky warmth and a slight mulchy quality that probably comes from the hot vintage. But it's holding in there with ripe black cherry and berry flavors that are accented by chocolate, vanilla and cola. Has grabby tannins and is ready to go now.",86,15,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6401","France","Very pure—this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years.",91,25,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6402","France","This is very smoky, with flavors of bacon as well as a yeasty character. The fruit has migrated into a taut texture, spiced with parsley and bay leaf. It's mature yet still zesty.",91,32,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6403","France","Rounded and rich, this is an impressive wine. It has weight, with ripe yellow and white fruits to go with the intense acidity and citrus edge. The finish is crisp and taut. It's worth aging this wine for 2–3 years.",91,45,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6404","Italy","Small additions of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon result in an elegant blend with measured fruit intensity and lasting impressions of blue flowers, licorice and almond paste. You can really taste the delicate Sangiovese component.",88,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6405","Italy","The hot vintage definitely left its mark on this Cabernet Sauvignon from the Montalcino area. Coffee, vanilla, fudge and espresso bean are backed by jammy fruit and ripe berries. In the mouth, it shows firm tannins and good length.",88,41,"Tuscany","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6406","Argentina","Roasted berry and plum aromas go counter to the wine's tough, tannic, semisour feel and flavor profile. Lean, a little choppy and tight in the mouth, with herbal cherry notes on the finish. Generic except for its hardness.",83,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6407","Austria","From one of the high vineyards on the slopes of the Schrattenthal, this complex Riesling has a fine initial raciness, then opens into perfumed white fruits touched by spice, apricots and a layer of tense minerality. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",90,23,"Niederösterreich","Riesling",48.108077,15.8049558,3
"6408","Argentina","If an intense style of Malbec is not your thing, then keep searching because this is intense in every way. The bouquet is dark and sun-drenched, with berry jam, leather and bacon aromas. The mouth shows huge blackberry, blueberry and black olive tastes, and the finish is warm and earthy, with espresso blackness. Shows every bit of its 14.9% alcohol but can handle it.",90,25,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"6409","France","Pommard suits the Bouchard Aîné style. The tannins and the power, forced by the dry core, are a house signature. That said, the ripeness of 2005 also plays a part in this opulent wine. The dryness comes through more obviously, but that suggests some aging ability.",90,66,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6410","Austria","A very taut, tight wine, crisp, green, perfumed. It has delicious white currants and hedgerow fruits, its delicacy and elegance balanced by its intensity of flavor. There is a definite herbal, mineral aftertaste. Screwcap.",90,25,"Kamptal","Riesling",48.585085,15.4126618,3
"6411","Spain","The hefty nose forces out spice and mildly-baked aromas of blackberries, while the palate delivers legitimate berry flavors touched up by accents of dill and butter. The finish is expansive and drying, with solid tannins. This is the best of what's on offer from Bodegas Los Llanos.",85,15,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"6412","France","This is intensely minerally and very tight. It has a real steely character, with its acidity packed tight into the concentrated texture, making this dense wine likely to age over three years.",91,45,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6413","Spain","Consistency is apparently not Fransola's calling card. One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark. Seems like Sauvignon Blanc in Catalonia needs ample heat to show the ginger, lime and apple characteristics that make it a likable. In this case, that's mostly what's on display.",88,29,"Catalonia","Sauvignon Blanc",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"6414","Spain","The essence of 2005 is captured in this creamy, rich offering that touches up against overripe but pulls back into balance at the last moment. Expect soft tannins, lots of coconutty oak and molasses notes along with a limited but easygoing finish. Drink soon.",88,45,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6415","Australia","A nicely balanced Chardonnay, marrying subtle buttered apple notes with bolder notes of toasted hazelnut and white peaches. It's got a silky texture and plenty of intensity on the fresh, citrusy finish. Drink now–2012.",88,25,"Western Australia","Chardonnay",-27.6728168,121.6283098,2
"6416","Italy","This Montalcino-based Merlot has a lot going on but is just a tad too raw and ripe to break into the 90-points range. On the nose, it offers a mélange of strawberry, blueberry, almond, balsam notes and mint. The tannins are silky and smooth.",88,42,"Tuscany","Merlot",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6417","Argentina","Baked, saucy and mildly burnt smelling, with a sweet, faux-chocolate edge to balance things out. The palate is bland and creamy, with milk chocolate, baked fruit and pepper flavors. Has thickness but is challenged in terms of taste and aromas.",83,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6418","Argentina","Aromas of apple cider are a touch acrid, while the palate is wet and easy but low in acidity. Flavors of melon and white fruits show some bitterness and break up in front of a flat finish.",83,11,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"6419","France","A charged Burgundy, packed with dense tannins and powerful ripe black berry fruits. There's a delicious tension here between the fruits and the tannin, pushing the acidity, the red plums and strawberries forward, but keeping them in check. At this stage, it needs decanting; otherwise keep for 2–3 years.",90,48,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6420","Austria","A delicious, creamy, perfumed wine, all fresh acidity, lively white fruits and softness. The acidity is infectious, giving great lift to this enjoyably crisp wine.",90,29,"Kamptal","Riesling",48.585085,15.4126618,3
"6421","France","Sumptuous and creamy, this is a deliciously ripe wine. It balances fresh white fruits against almonds and a rounded structure. Perhaps the acidity is lost in all the richness, but it's a wine to relish now.",89,47,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6422","Spain","Smooth, savory and spicy, but with enough red-fruit character to ensure that it doesn't taste dull. The palate offers orderly berry and pepper flavors, while it ends with vanilla and a hint of campfire. Juicy and fairly fresh, but a little thin and watery across the palate. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",85,11,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6423","Spain","Opens with spice notes of cinnamon and anise before transitioning to fuller cherry and plum flavors. The mouthfeel is warm and fatty, while the finish still holds some buttery notes and tannic grip. Nothing spectacular but not bad for a 1999 wine from Valdepeñas.",84,13,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"6424","Spain","Blackberry and bramble work the nose, with a medium-bodied, generously oaked palate to follow. In the mouth, buttery oak leads the way with dark fruit, wood resin and chewiness coming next. Not overly tannic, but short on the finish. Pretty easygoing as a whole.",85,16,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6425","Spain","Freshness is in demand as the nose shows dampness, tobacco and wood more than bright fruit. In the mouth, there's oak-driven flavors of vanilla and tobacco accenting basic red fruit. Has a lot of snap and zest but comes off kind of thin and on the mature side. Drink now for best results; its lifespan appears limited.",85,28,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6426","Spain","Warm, fruity and full of blackberry aromas as well as touches of citrus peel. The palate is lean and firm in the middle and tannic on the sides, and it's carrying flavors of raspberry and black cherry. This wine has good stuff but it also runs choppy, jagged and rough. Flavorful but lacks finesse. 50,000 cases made.",85,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6427","Spain","Fairly dark and chocolaty on the nose, with some vanilla oak notes that help it along. The mouthfeel, however, is a bit choppy and tangy as red fruit and acidity come up and take over the game. Short on the finish, with oak filling any gaps left by the fading fruit. Good and ready to go now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",85,14,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6428","Australia","Starts with scents of pear and melon, butter and spice, but takes on an ever-larger oak presence in the mouth, adding more and more wood spice and cedar. Not sure if this will ever completely integrate, so the best bet seems to be drinking earlier rather than later.",88,30,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"6429","Italy","With a beautiful, newly inaugurated winery in place, Rocca di Montemassi's Sangiovese-based Le Focaie will be a wine to watch in the future. This vintage showcases sweet, plump cherry, vanilla and well-integrated oak nuances. A plush, velvety feel characterizes the mouth.",88,11,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6430","Spain","Dark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging. The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.",88,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6431","Argentina","Fairly citrusy and lean for a reserve-level Malbec. The nose is short, high-toned and shows aromas of red fruits, citrus and even celery. The palate is fresh but tight and drying, with raspberry flavors and cherry skins and tomato on the finish. A red-dominant wine.",83,16,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6432","Argentina","Smoke and earth notes vie with leather, olive, herbal scents and baked fruit aromas prior to a syrupy, sweet and cloying berry fruit palate. Lacks drive and spine as it comes across heavy, and the finish is syrupy and herbal, with a rubbery bite at the end.",83,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6433","Argentina","Rather flat and oily smelling, resulting in a low-pulse bouquet. The mouth is wet and chunky as it features sweet mango and cantaloupe flavors. Orange candy and sweetness is about all you get on the finish.",82,16,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2

"6435","Austria","No surprise that Willi Bründlmayer is one of the few in Austria to have real success with Pinot Noir. This is soft, ripe, enveloping, with bitter cherry flavors rounded at the edges with sweet tannins and refreshing acidity.",89,60,"Kamptal","Pinot Noir",48.585085,15.4126618,3
"6436","Argentina","Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",89,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6437","France","Very fresh, very raspberry, this wine opens gently with sweetness and roundness. The tannins do come into play, but ever so gently, a counterpoint to the sweet, fine fruits that dominate this attractive, relatively early drinking wine.",89,40,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6438","Spain","Earthy and mossy initially, with notes of coffee and mocha. The flavors of spiced red fruit are solid and fresh, but the wine comes up short on flesh and feel. In fact, it's quite lean and acidic, which means a food partner is almost mandatory.",84,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"6440","Spain","A snappy, jumpy type of wine that delivers aromas of red fruit and spice, but there's something piercing about it, too. The palate is clean and tight, with lots of cranberry/raspberry flavors framed by citrusy notes. Best if you prefer a leaner, shorter, crisper type of red.",85,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6441","Spain","The muscularity and meatiness of the nose indicate ripeness, while the aromas veer toward drying oak and a bit of raisin. The palate is chunky and dark, with subdued berry flavors front and center. And the weight is up there, especially for a youngster that spent only four months in oak.",85,18,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6442","Australia","Fat and a bit oily in texture, this is neither as floral or expressive as Riesling can be, but it still makes for a goodd drop. Scents and flavors of peach, superripe apples and a touch of melon finish dry, with a slight hint of bitterness.",85,14,"Tasmania","Riesling",-41.4545196,145.9706647,3
"6443","Spain","Plenty ripe, in fact it's on the edge of raisiny but not quite over the line. The palate runs surprisingly racy with a lot of acidity, yet the flavor profile is short and drying. Shows a flash or two but it's not a complete wine and not worth the high price tag.",84,55,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6444","Spain","A very smoky, meaty, heavily oaked style of Ribera Del Duero, and one that never reaches a level where the fruit can escape the oak boundaries. Yes, the palate has berry flavors and snap, but there's also a ton of pepper, vanilla and burnt spices that keep it under wraps. And the bet here is that time will not make it better.",84,22,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6445","Argentina","Gaseous aromas include notes of animal, burnt meat and muddy earth. The palate is gummy and cloying, with sweet, syrupy flavors of candied fruit. Shows a weedy character and a jumbled persona.",81,13,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6446","Argentina","Narrow aromas of brick dust, tomato and dried fruits are none too impressive, and the sticky palate of sweet, baked, candied black fruit tastes more like molasses than anything. Gritty and burnt tasting on the finish.",81,9,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6447","Argentina","An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food.",89,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"6449","Austria","Hints of honey are an aromatic giveaway for the sweetness of this wine. But its sweetness is balanced by intense acidity, very fresh baked apple flavor and crisp green fruits. The aftertaste is mineral and fresh, but with pure, sweet acidity. Screwcap.",89,31,"Niederösterreich","Riesling",48.108077,15.8049558,3
"6450","Argentina","For several vintages running Broquel has nudged the border between very good and excellent, but as in years past the '06 is a touch tangy and racy, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. It's bold, zippy and quite high-toned, but still it's very competent and held together.",89,17,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6451","Spain","Sweaty and pickled at first, although airing reveals some hidden dark fruit aromas.

Has it good points but lacks direction and elegance.",84,11,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6452","Chile","Firm and condensed, but with the potential to unfold over the next three years. Cassis, tobacco, eucaplytus and dry berry aromas are classy and convincing; the palate is firm and defined by powerful cherry and cassis. Fold in toast and spice on the finish and you have a serious Cabernet Sauvignon that defines good value.",91,21,"Aconcagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3
"6453","Chile","Dark, sweet, subtle and smooth, with complexity that's unleashed with proper airing. There's minerality and perfume on the nose, and while it's rich and supple in the mouth, the blackberry, raisin and fig flavors are not saggy. Pillowy, but with good concentration.

"6455","Chile","Opens with a good spread of herbs, perfume, black fruit and sauciness, while the palate is lively and healthy, with raspberry, plum and herbal shadings.

"6539","New Zealand","This vintage of Peg Bay's Pinot shows the firm structure of the year, suggesting 2–3 years of cellaring. But while the black cherry fruit may not be immediately accessible, there's plenty of it, touched with herbal, minty complexity and a touch of oaky toast on the finish.",90,41,"Waipara Valley","Pinot Noir",-43.076058,172.704133,3
"6540","New Zealand","Lovely scents of toasted hazelnuts, apple and lime set the stage for a top-flight Chardonnay. It's medium- to full-bodied, round and broad in the mouth, then gains focus on the lime-driven finish. Delicious now, and should hold up well in the cellar for up to six years.",90,32,"Nelson","Chardonnay",-41.2706319,173.2839653,2
"6541","Argentina","Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.",87,32,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6542","France","Ripe and soft, this revels in its jammy Pinot Noir character. The dry tannins creep in later, supporting open red fruit flavors topped with black plum skins. The finish is all strawberry jam.",86,33,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6543","Argentina","Blueberry with snap is the way to describe the bouquet on this fresh and spunky young Malbec. The flavors are sweet and intense, just like grapes off the vine. It doesn't offer much complexity but at the same time it doesn't taste confected or flawed in any way.",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6544","Argentina","Achaval's Uco Valley single-vineyard Malbec is strapping and minerally, with exotic black-fruit aromas darkened up by road tar but lightened by violets. It's focused and bright, with juicy cherry and black-plum flavors. Pure and direct, with a long finish. Drink now through 2013.",91,112,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6545","Spain","Exemplary Ribera del Duero, given that '02 was not a great year. This wine, however, pours on the richness fans of this region are looking for. The palate is lush and ripe, with deep plum and blackberry flavors supported by mocha and earth shadings. Offers a little bit of everything.",90,38,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6546","New Zealand","This winery seems to be at the top of its game in recent vintages, and this Pinot Noir is a good value as well. Slightly dusty, floral notes add complexity to its spice and cherry aromas, while the mouthfeel is silky but not too soft. Finishes with hints of tea and rose petals. No need to wait on this one; drink now.",89,23,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"6548","New Zealand","Always more precocious than Kumeu River's Maté's Vineyard Chardonnay, this bottling nevertheless seems to be moving in a tighter, more restrained direction. The citrus and pineapple flavors are reined in by structure, finishing lean and citrusy, with just enough peach to provide flesh. Drink now–2012.",90,33,"Kumeu","Chardonnay",-36.7772623,174.5588019,2

"6550","Argentina","Earthy and tight on the nose, with notes of wintergreen and fresh herbs. The palate is lean and drawing, while the flavors revolve around sweet berry fruit, earth and oak. Dry, peppery and a little bitter on the finish, but spicy and real. Nice and varietally correct for Argentinean Pinot.",87,18,"Mendoza Province","Pinot Noir",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6551","Argentina","More baked, muddled and heavy than Alicia's Paso de Piedra bottling, with roasted plum/berry flavors and a heavy, forceful palate that carries some burn, heat and rubber. Big and bullish, like a proverbial toro in a china shop. A lot of oak, too.",87,27,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6552","Spain","Sassy pepper and light rhubarb aromas give this medium-weight crianza a spicy, lean outlook.

A wine for current consumption.",85,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6553","Australia","Despite a slightly bitter edge to its raspberry and charred-oak flavors, this medium-bodied Pinot Noir delivers plenty of pleasure.

"6554","Italy","Here's a rare find and an excellent wine. Bastia is a creamy Chardonnay that is aged 15 months in oak for softness and richness. The aromas include peach apricot, vanilla extract and butter. Pair it with roasted turkey or quail.",91,50,"Piedmont","Chardonnay",45.0522366,7.5153885,2
"6555","New Zealand","Almost more of a white Graves style than a traditional New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, featuring a kiss of French oak and ample body without any overt pungency.

"6556","New Zealand","Not a stereotypical New World fruit-driven Pinot, this is a dark and stormy night—filled with earthy notes, tobacco, soy and root vegetables, with a wiry structure and firm finish that call Burgundy to mind. Drink 2007–2010.",89,30,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"6557","Spain","Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.",82,29,"Northern Spain","Merlot",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6558","Spain","Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",81,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6559","Italy","Immediately, you know you are before a great Brunello with bright fruit aromas backed by forest floor, balsam notes, bramble, blue flowers, red apple and mint. The presence of wood is all but invisible and the wine sings true to its territory and tradition. The wine's natural acidity and intensity promise a long and glorious aging future before it.",96,400,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6560","Argentina","Huge and extracted, with an opaque purple color and a massive, aggressive nose that hints at stewed fruit, sweaty leather, blackberry compote and shoe polish. Forget elegance and go straight for this wine's unbridled size and density. If that sounds unappealing, pass it by.",85,11,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6561","Chile","Opens up with welcoming kiwi, green melon and powdered sugar aromas, which are backed by melon and mild green pepper flavors.

More than solid, with lots of mainstream potential.",87,11,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6562","Italy","Bargain wine hunters can count on Tormaresca (Antinori's Tuscany estate) to deliver the goods when it comes to good value. This barrel-fermented Chardonnay is the product of fertile soils, strong sunshine and cutting-edge technology. Aromas of apricot, yellow rose, honey and cantaloupe melon are both intense and inviting. In the mouth, the wine is creamy and filling with penetrating stone fruit flavors and persistency. Try it with shrimp cocktail or spicy chicken.",87,8,"Southern Italy","Chardonnay",27.6745009,-82.7263505,2
"6563","Chile","Purple in color, with blackberry and leather aromas. Black cherry and plum lead the flavor profile, while coffee, toast and black pepper carry the finish. Has good acidity but seems a touch short on depth and complexity.",87,13,"Colchagua Valley","Malbec",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"6564","Chile","Kicks off a touch loud and syrupy, with jammy berry aromas. The mouthfeel is full and round, while the flavors are deep and veer toward chocolate, plum and blackberry. Finishes with notable caramel and carob flavors.",87,12,"Central Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"6565","Chile","Arguably a bit overwooded, but if you like a hefty wine (14.5%) with an oily feel, this is it. The mouthfeel is slick and a bit greasy, but with extract to spare that's the way it is. The flavors are big and typical, with peach, apple and popcorn. A big boy from the Southern Hemisphere.",87,15,"Limarí Valley","Chardonnay",-30.7462002,-71.0022311,2
"6566","New Zealand","This mainstream Sauvignon Blanc shows some herbal, grassy notes on the nose, but also ripe nectarine and stone fruit scents. It's round in the mouth, with a silky texture and a similar blend of flavors, with tropical and stone fruits accented by slight herbaceousness. Smooth and softly lingering on the finish.",88,17,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6567","New Zealand","Robust and flavorful, Nobilo's top Pinot Noir is undeniably toasty, but it also features burly cola and plum flavors to match the oak. Big-boned and firmly structured, drink 2008–09.",88,22,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6568","New Zealand","Another inky-dark 2005 Marlborough Pinot, Spy Valley's rendition is assertive and plummy, but perhaps lacking a little bit of perfume. Slightly creamy in texture without being particularly lush, it finishes long and clean.",88,29,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6569","Spain","Shows good fruit aromas, moderate depth and a touch of sandalwood on the nose. The palate features ripe blackberry and chocolate, while the feel is cushioned and chewy. Modern in style; just a cut below the 2001.",88,44,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6570","Spain","A lot of dill and coconut on the nose, and that dill character remains on the palate and finish.

"6571","Australia","Weedy on the nose one moment, sweet the next. Feels halfhearted on the palate, and missing verve. Still, it offers black and purple berry fruit, and moderate tannins. Imported by Click Wine Group.",84,35,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6572","Spain","Initial aromas of tree bark, root beer and leather give way to stronger, obvious oak notes. Very snappy on the palate; in fact, it's downright sharp and acidic in the midpalate. Has its positives but is too racy and shrill in the middle. Imported by Haro Imports.",84,34,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6573","Australia","This is a slimmer-sized Merlot that features accents of seeped tea and mocha on the palate, with fruit playing second fiddle. Aromas are of baked fruit and cream. Good for casual gatherings. Imported by Southcorp Wines.",84,10,"South Australia","Merlot",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6574","Italy","A liquid lullaby more than a wine, this Brunello caresses and smoothes over your senses with amazing intensity and harmonious aromas of cherry-chocolate fudge, almond paste, ginger, balsamic notes, blueberry pie, firewood and vanilla. There's a shroud of cedar and cherry fruit within the wine's unwavering structure and a seemingly endless finish.",95,60,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6575","France","A beautiful rounded wine, full of juicy fruit, but sustained by a strong tannic structure. This dryness suggests good aging potential, as does the ripeness of the fruit and the acidity. Keep for at least 6 years.",94,95,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6576","Italy","Perfectly nice but a little heavy, with low-to-medium acidity and a stout mouthfeel. Along the way there's rubber, violet and berry aromas as well as chewy cherry and raspberry flavors. Modest on the finish, with easy tannins.",87,16,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6577","Chile","After a number of years of experimenting with Cab from cooler Casablanca, Veramonte has turned to warmer Maipo for this nicely made wine that offers red licorice and cinnamon aromas in front of bright cassis and raspberry flavors. Shows purity, spice and character.",87,10,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6578","Chile","Here's a nice and dark Cab with black licorice, clove, pepper and blackberry aromas. The palate is ripe and sweet, with roundness and serious depth. Finishes with chocolate and mint as well as some lushness.",87,12,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6579","Australia","The brand is Wakefield here in the U.S., but Taylors in Australia; Taylors is one of the biggest brands out of Clare.

"6580","Australia","From the Bowral region, one hour south of Sydney, this is a slightly herbal and green-tinged Pinot Noir, but one with considerable cherry intensity and a woody overlay. It's a good, medium-bodied effort, but could use a touch more richness and complexity overall.",85,33,"New South Wales","Pinot Noir",-31.2532183,146.921099,3

"6582","Argentina","A standard wine with ample berry and plum aromas supported by blackberry, plum and chocolate flavor. It's simple but smooth, with generic berry flavors, decent mouthfeel and length. Expect only the basics and it'll rank as good everyday wine.",85,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6583","New Zealand","A good value for fans of the style, Saint Clair's 2006 Sauvignon Blanc continues this winery's leaning toward bell pepper and passion fruit aromas buoyed by bold, flashy tropical fruit flavors. Round and soft in the mouth, but shows good persistence on the finish.",88,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6584","Spain","Sweet and spicy stuff, with plenty of oak-based coconut and butter on the nose. In the mouth, it's quite saturated and flush, with overt plum, blackberry and wood resin notes. A big, modern wine that's a bit oafish but also rather easy to drink.",87,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6585","Austria","A nice package, but one that lacks intensity. Begins with hints of apple, pear and honey, then delivers understated lime and mineral flavors. Tart and mouthwatering on the finish. Imported by Vin Divino.",84,17,"Langenlois","Riesling",48.4738543,15.692843,3
"6586","France","This wine is dense and tough, the fruit submerged under the tannins. It has great fresh acidity though which shows that the fruit just needs the time to balance out. But it is certainly young; give it 6–7 years at least.",93,90,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6587","France","An impressive wine, fueled by black plum juice flavors. The acidity is just right, balancing the richness of the fruit. The wine revels in the serious side of Echezeaux, packed with dark, tight tannins over the fruit. It needs at least five years, maybe 10.",93,115,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6588","Italy","Here's a Brunello that plays on the variety's subtle and refined notes of forest berry and boysenberry rather than ripe cherry; almonds or roasted chestnuts rather than obvious wood. It's a beautiful product with understated power and intensity that lets its elegant nature shine bright.",92,80,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6589","Australia","McLaren Vale is not renowned for its white wines, yet this Chardonnay is a very good, appealing sip. It's medium-sized with apple and pear aromas and flavors dominating.

"6590","Chile","A perfectly good Chardonnay, one with lemon curd, butter, peach and melon on the nose.

Great for everyday drinking.",86,11,"Curicó Valley","Chardonnay",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,2

"6592","Argentina","Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",84,11,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6593","Argentina","Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas.

Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.",84,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6594","Argentina","Forward and lively but challenged and pithy. The apricot and melon flavors are bolstered by acidity, but the wine tastes more citric and snappy than suave. And the finish also doesn't offer much beyond citrus. Definitely not lifeless but where's the Chardonnay character?",84,12,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"6595","Argentina","Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",84,35,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6596","Spain","Brick colored, with a baked, spicy nose that is true Rioja in that it also pushes Sherry, raisin and cinnamon notes. Fairly dry, acidic and zesty in the mouth, with cherry and cola flavors. Forceful acidity keeps it moving along. Needs food to absorb that acid.",87,18,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6597","Spain","Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom.

Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.",87,12,"Catalonia","Pinot Noir",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"6598","New Zealand","New World Chardonnay, done well. Toasty, mealy aromas accent slightly tropical, peach-like scents on the nose, while the flavors are ripe and fruit-driven, suitably framed by butter and toast.

"6601","Spain","The bouquet begins with uncanny aromas of Italian bitters before turning fat and sweet. The palate is thin and stretched out, with flavors of strawberry and citrus zest. Sort of spicy but more stripped down and dull than exciting. Imported by Baron Francois Collection.",83,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6602","Spain","Aromas of warm cedar planks, tobacco and mushroom turn more murky and leafy with air. Quite acidic, which is why the wine is still kicking and screaming.

Not complex but quite pleasant.",86,13,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"6605","Italy","It has been years since we reviewed Burchino, and it's more or less the same wine now that it was in 1997. The nose offers light fruit and cinnamon shadings, which sit in front of strawberry and plum flavors. The finish may be a touch raw and grabby, but as a whole it's snappy enough to stay the course.",86,13,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6606","Chile","Blueberry and a hint of bacon get it going. Next up is a dense palate that offers touches of mushroom, spice and gentle black fruit. Not at all racy or loud; the wine lacks bold acidity but still registers as mostly balanced.",86,12,"Maipo Valley","Syrah",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6607","Chile","Barnyard meets pickle at first, but airing gives more clarity to the nose. The palate is a bit murky but it's also loaded with meat, cola and dark, almost baked fruit.

"6608","Chile","Plum, blackberry and other dark fruits coat the smooth bouquet. The palate is fairly intense, with saturated plum and berry flavors.

"6609","France","If Nuits-Saint-Georges has a gentler side when young (as a contrast to the normal firm tannins), this wine shows it.

"6610","Chile","A warm, dry vintage yielded an excellent Casa Real in 2003. The wine delivers a measured bouquet of balsam wood, violet petals, mineral and ripe berry aromas, while the leisurely palate is home to spot-on raspberry, black plum and cassis flavors.

"6611","Italy","Here's a gorgeous Brunello that achieves that ever-so delicate balance of fruit versus menthol notes versus toast to render an unforgettable drinking experience. This is why they say Brunello can't be made in any other part of the world outside this tiny corner of Tuscany: Intense notes of chewy cherry, carob, licorice, almonds, chopped herbs ride over dusty tannins and a long finish.",92,120,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"6619","Spain","This wine proves that “organic” doesn't automatically translate into great. The nose is leathery and sweet, with red licorice and peanut aromas. Sweet and sugary on the palate, with flavors of beets and fruit roll-up. Hard and reduced on the finish.

"6624","New Zealand","Saint Clair's Reserve and single-block bottlings are consistently top-notch, and this concentrated Sauvignon maintains that tradition.

"6626","Australia","Assertively toasty and nutty, this is barrel-fermented in new oak, but in 500-liter puncheons, not the smaller barriques, so that the wood doesn't overwhelm.

"6632","Italy","Fresh asphalt, burning timber, bitter chocolate, and anything else that connotes “darkness” is what this heavyweight is about. And as rough as that may sound aromatically, on the palate it's polished like a gemstone, with just enough grit and guts to push it forward. The fruit, meanwhile, is sensational, a panoply of black plums and cherries infused with cocoa and vanilla. This offers a clear look into 21st-century Brunello, and the picture is breathtaking.

"6633","Italy","Saturated to the max, with a violet/ruby tint that shows no breaks. If it looks like an extracted bruiser, it is.

"6634","Italy","Smooth and lush, with a ton of berry, cherry and smoke character. Supremely ripe and full, with chocolate and spice mixed into the prime cherry/berry palate.

Imported by Banfi Vintners.",94,150,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6635","Italy","Wonderfully toasted up front, with baked, but not cooked, fruit aromas. There's also plenty of coffee, earth and leather to the bouquet. Initial live-wire flavors settle to reveal marzipan and dried stone fruits, while the sly finish is so complex that the wine ultimately registers as a different breed. Drinking this is like navigating a maze. A Marc de Grazia Selection, various importers.",94,90,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6636","Italy","Big and brawny, with a blinding violet color and a bouquet bursting with rich oak. In fact, this wine features as much new oak as any normale on the market. But with such quality fruit, the nose quickly morphs into high-grade tobacco and pure vanilla. In the mouth, things run deep and thick, and any potential corpulence is balanced by ripe tannins and fresh acids. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",93,72,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6637","Italy","Surprisingly sweet but lovable just the same. The nose offers sugared doughnut and marzipan aromas yet the palate has cut-through acidity that ensures that the wine is neither flabby nor dull.

"6638","Italy","Smoky and dark, with potent char and tar elements to the bouquet. Look for sweet cherry and plum flavors floating on a bed of soft, smooth tannins.

"6639","Argentina","Saturated in color. Smells rugged, like tire rubber and tar mixed with blackberry. Beautiful tasting, with black cherry, licorice and minerality on a firm, no-flab palate.

"6643","Chile","Aromas of cherry and strawberry are alluring, but the mouth is rock hard and very tannic. Flavors of raspberry and cassis are lively and drill deep, but you have to have a brick layer's tolerance for tannins to get the most of this wine. Should be served with meat or other big foods.",85,14,"Cachapoal Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3

"6645","Chile","Not the most Syrah-like wine you're likely to encounter, but as a generic red it's juicy, fruity and tasty. The balance is fine and the fruit weighs in solid and proper. Complete but lacking individuality.",85,15,"Maipo Valley","Syrah",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6646","Chile","Heavily oaked, with pineapple and toast aromas. Very round in the mouth, and smooth, but ultimately it's not that lively or flavorful. The apple and spice flavors kind of lay flat on the palate, while the finish is rather oak-dominant.",85,17,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"6647","Argentina","Some wines in this range have it and others kind of struggle. This one seems to be fighting an uphill battle. The nose is unfocused and a little mulchy, while the flavors are jammy, sweet and basic. Tannin and acidity keep it cranking, but is that good?",83,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6648","Argentina","Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",83,12,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6649","Argentina","Average red juice with sweet, rubbery aromas and flavors that match. It's Malbec in its most simple state: raspberry and cherry distilled into a quaffable liquid. Chilling might help.",83,7,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6650","Argentina","Waxy aromas of scented candles and canned pears define the nose. The palate is low on acid and thus tastes soft and remotely of Bartlett pear and peach. Light on the finish; thus it needs to be drunk now.",82,12,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"6651","Italy","Ripe berry fruit, cherry and blackberry are backed by exotic spice and generous vanilla essence to create the backbone of this compelling Brunello. There's nice complexity here with distant, playful notes of dried blue flower, rose bud and natural rubber that work well together. In the mouth, the wine has a solid, gritty texture and vibrant fruit flavors.",91,65,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"6655","New Zealand","This is from a part of New Zealand not known for its Pinot Noir, but don't discount it for that—it offers plenty of Pinot character, from its earth, mushroom and cola-scented bouquet to its plump, silky texture and tart, sour-cherry finish.

"6656","Italy","Tight as a drum, almost to the point that it's constricted. Airing it unlocks cinnamon, chocolate and smoky leather aromas on top of blackberry, cherry and vanilla. Full in the middle, and less oaky and chunky than many others. This is a wine with guts and framing, yet it goes easy on the finish.

"6657","New Zealand","Major-league Syrah from New Zealand? You bet. Tips the scales at 15.4% alcohol, yet never seems hot. Instead, you get a wonderfully balanced wine loaded with cassis and blackberry fruit, but also notes of coffee and ground pepper.

"6658","Italy","Stout but intoxicating, with floral aromas along with hints of maple, leather and pepper.

"6659","Italy","The brilliant ruby color conveys density, and the bouquet is deliciously smooth.

Warm, meaty and wickedly good. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.",92,49,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6660","Italy","Doesn't seem that concentrated at first, but builds powerfully on the finish, giving it good promise for the future.

"6661","Argentina","Exotic and refined, with a stately bouquet of violets, mineral and cassis. Sensational quality for a wine from rugged Patagonia. It bursts with black raspberry propelled by firm acids. Then it folds back into a darker space, where fudge and pepper notes make for a warming, spicy finish. Shows off the skill of Danish winemaker Hans Vinding-Diers.",92,140,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"6662","Italy","Intoxicatingly smoky nose, like fine wood burning slowly on a cold night. The mouth is jam-packed with vanilla, chocolate and cream as well as black cherry and dark currants.

"6663","France","A little pretentious with the appellation (it could be Pouilly-Fumï¿½), but nothing but great wine in the bottle. Aromas of grapefruit, apple, mustard and wet stones are framed by gentle notes of cinnamon and toast. The palate is louder as it sizzles with razor-crisp orange, apple, peach and grapefruit, all with a proper mineral, herbal edge. Rock solid, but cheerful and universally likable.

"6664","New Zealand","Shows all the requisite pea, pepper and tropical fruit in front of an intense palate that comes on like an explosion of melon, nectarine and grapefruit.

"6665","Italy","Looks good, smells good and tastes good, too. Displays a dark ruby luster, while the nose is full of oak, leather, black cherry, marzipan and citrus peel. And the palate is sweet and rich as it pours on chocolate, liqueur and ultra-mild tannins. At more than 12,000 cases of production, this Antinori wine should be relatively easy to find.

"6666","Argentina","The inaugural premium Malbec from Montes S.A.'s fledgling Argentinean venture displays round, attractive aromas of concentrated black fruit and hefty oak.

Tremendously satisfying.",91,23,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6667","Italy","Almost opaque in color, with more smoke and leather than opulent fruit.

"6668","Italy","Exceptionally spicy on the nose, with forest floor, leather and pepper as well as ample berry fruit. Round and likable, with plum, chocolate, vanilla and toast flavors. What brings this wine up is that it has a few levels of complexity. The finish, for example, is at first juicy. But then it runs long and spicy. Rock-solid Brunello from a consistent producer. Imported by Kobrand.",91,55,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6669","Chile","Firm, a touch rubbery, and quite full-bodied, with earthy aromas of coffee and black fruits. Cassis and berry are the primary flavors, while the saturated palate is chewy and dense.

"6670","Italy","Light, fresh and clean as a whistle. Here's an easygoing Chianti that pushes red-fruit aromas toward a palate that's zesty and full of crisp cherry and raspberry flavors. Some might find it too tangy and racy; but if you like a leaner version of red wine it will do the trick.",85,9,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"6673","Austria","A Sauvignon Blanc with a Muscat aroma? That's the curious thing about this perfumed wine. It's pleasant, very fresh, perfumed like a candy shop, but has little to do with Sauvignon Blanc flavors. Screwcap.",82,17,"Burgenland","Sauvignon Blanc",47.1537165,16.2688797,3

"6675","New Zealand","A relatively new producer in the Bendigo region of Central Otago, this wine won big at the annual Air New Zealand Wine Awards and it's easy to see why.

"6677","Chile","Rich, succulent and exotic, this Syrah captures the appealing spice and leather notes that are capable of accenting any good red wine. Alongside there's immense black fruit flavors and an underbelly of oaky coffee and mocha. A  touch narrow and short on the finish.",91,45,"Maipo Valley","Syrah",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"6682","Argentina","Smells a little hot and peppery, but the palate is big and expansive, with generous flavors of blackberry and vanilla.

"6691","Italy","Plum, cranberry and cherry—but not too much oak—make for a lovely nose, while the soft-ish palate is more round than blisteringly tannic. Midpalate and finishing flavors of espresso and chocolate seem oak-related, yet there's no woody resin flavors to detract from the purity. Meets all the standards of a fine wine without forcing it. Imported by Vinifera Imports.",90,75,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6692","Italy","A touch of barnyard at first gives way to deep, dark fruit that's spun tight on the palate. As it opens, bigger berry and black cherry flavors emerge. Tight and tannic on the back palate, with an uncomplicated finish. An excellent wine, but one competing in a talented field. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",90,85,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6693","New Zealand","Wonderfully clean and pure, with aromas of peaches, limes and wet stones. On the palate, there's soft, ripe stone fruit, but also powerful citrus notes to provide focus. Finishes dry and tart, crisp and refreshing. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.",90,14,"Marlborough","Riesling",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6694","Italy","Tobacco, earth and tree bark make for a bouquet that doesn't hit you over the head. Still, it has red fruit galore. The palate is tight, ripe and chock full of proper acidity and tannins. A lively wine with vanilla and oak coming on late. Solid stuff. Imported by Vias Imports.",90,57,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6695","Italy","Almost stewy but not totally over the top. The nose offers more earth and oak than brightness, while the palate is herb-infused, with berry and tomato. Fairly classic in style, but not as fresh as desirable.",84,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6696","Chile","Supple and round, this is an easy-drinking Merlot with defined varietal character. It's slightly herbal on the nose, then adds mocha notes to the black cherry and plum flavors that turn a bit crisp.",84,12,"Central Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"6697","Chile","Aromatically, it's light, with leafiness and citrus peel scents. Cherry, cassis and olive flavors float on a bed of firm tannins, while the finish is toasty and slightly medicinal.",84,9,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3

"6699","Spain","Modest on the nose, and then very little after that. The flavors are basic lime and citrus, and the feel is tangy and lemony sharp. Generic, with little to no varietal character.",81,13,"Central Spain","Sauvignon Blanc",40.463667,-3.74922,1

"6701","France","From Bouchard's home vineyard, this is one of their signature wines. In 2005, it has produced a luscious, fruity wine whose richness is only a part of its wonderful floating character. The ripeness of the wine is matched by its structure, which promises considerable aging.",94,42,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6702","Italy","Fresh black cherries, coffee, chocolate, and delicate notes of crushed mint characterize this plump, juicy Merlot. It boasts a dark ruby color and nice concentration that feels supple and creamy in the mouth. There's just enough structure to avoid flabbiness and to suggest a pairing with braised lamb or grilled meat.",90,39,"Sicily & Sardinia","Merlot",37.5999938,14.0153557,3
"6703","Spain","Attractive on the nose, with violet, cherry and a bit of candy. Round and satisfying in the mouth, with full berry flavors and mouthcoating tannins. Not all that nuanced or complex, but good in a dense, hit-me sort of way.",85,10,"Central Spain","Merlot",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"6704","New Zealand","Delivers really nice complexity and balance at a bargain price. The nose combines green leafy notes, a bit of asparagus and a hint of jalapeño with riper notes suggestive of honey and stone fruits.

"6705","Italy","Potent, tight and condensed on the nose, with a blast of woody smoke. Brighter on the palate, where cherry and plum ride high and confident. This is a lively, fresh wine with an extended finish of cherry, plum and licorice. It also shows a raw, leathery streak, good tannins and solid aging ability. Imported by Star Industries Inc.",90,48,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6706","Italy","Ripe, snappy, alert and forward, with aromas of toast and dried cherries. If you like a bit more red fruit than black in your Brunello, give this a shot. Cranberry, cherry and red plum flavors dominate, while the finish is crisp, with hints of pepper and spice. Lively but not terribly deep. Imported by Vias Imports.",90,53,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6707","Italy","Downright purple in color, so much so that it looks more like Merlot than Sangiovese. Smells incredibly rich, but not stewy. Concentrated and extracted palate, with no hard tannins or acids. Very smooth but short on the finish. Good for near-term drinking.

"6708","New Zealand","From the little-known region of Nelson, this Riesling bursts with petrol and lime scents. Quite full-bodied for a Riesling, with a touch of residual sugar and plenty of alcohol (12.5%), yet it retains a sense of grace and a finely developed minerality not often found in New World Riesling.

"6710","Italy","At 50,000 cases plus, this is as mass-market a wine as Brunello goes. But it's a darn good one, with tobacco, citrus and herbs on the nose. Runs a bit simple and grapy on the palate, but it's overwhelmingly ripe, healthy and full-force. Nothing tricky here, just clean cherry, plum and chocolate flavors sitting comfortably on a medium-to-full frame. Imported by Banfi Vintners.",90,68,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6711","Argentina","Clumsy at first, but admittedly tasted a month prior to release. Time frees up deep, sturdy fruit overlayed with a sheet of creamy oak that yields vanilla, resin and subtle spice flavors. Chunky and ripe; the berry fruit is 100% mature. Will knit together with more time in bottle. Better in 2006.",90,23,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6712","Italy","Blends aromas of blanched nuts, field greens and snappy fruit into a very nice whole. The palate is sharp and clean, with grassy notes along with apple and lime. Sort of New Zealand-like in its approach, with a finish that is precise and crisp. And there's just enough texture to the wine so that it isn't lean. Imported by Astoria.",90,20,"Northeastern Italy","Sauvignon Blanc",41.87194,12.56738,3
"6713","France","Immensely flowery, with pure honeysuckle and touches of melon on the summer-fresh nose. Rather full and big on the palate, with intense flavors of green melon, peach and spice. Only medium zest to the finish, but sneakily powerful. Imported by Rosenthal Wine Merchants.",90,23,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6714","Australia","Tastes and feels liberally wooded, with tobacco on the nose and plenty of wood on the palate and finish. Fruit underneath it is taut and red. It's very good, but maybe a little out of joint.",88,21,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6715","Argentina","Deep purple in hue, with saturated dark-fruit aromas along with pinches of cola and creamy oak. Fairly concentrated for a wine of this stature; for less than $10 you get vanilla and chocolate accents atop youthful, bouncy blackberry. The mouthfeel is plump, and there's a toasted coconut flavor on the finish.",87,8,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"6717","Chile","A dramatic contrast to Laroche's French Chardonnays, this one is loaded with tropical fruit and honey, dressed up with coconut oil and vanilla. It's unabashedly New World, yet finishes with firm, lime-like acidity.",87,13,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2

"6719","Chile","Sulfuric at first, and later it's strawberry and tomato that control the nose. In the mouth, it's sweet and a bit syrupy, with generic black fruit leading the way. Finishes with milk chocolate and a hint of burnt toast and grass.",83,11,"Rapel Valley","Merlot",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"6720","Chile","From “old” Syrah vines planted all of 15 years ago, this is a meaty and spicy wine that carries clove and licorice aromas in front of a full-bodied palate that houses black fruit, fennel and chocolate. Good acidity ensures that it flows across the tongue with snap and no overt heaviness.",90,36,"Rapel Valley","Syrah",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"6721","Chile","A price reduction this year brings this into Best Buy status. For the price, you'll be shocked by the wine's forward purity, bright acidity and wild raspberry, plum and other you-name-it fruits. If freshness and food-friendly zap are what you're after, this is recommended. Imported by Orvino Imports.",90,13,"Central Valley","Syrah",-36,-72,3
"6722","Chile","Spicy and earthy, with truffle, toast and strawberry aromas. The palate is bright and smooth, with a well-matched mix of plush fruit and juicy acidity.

Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.",90,18,"Casablanca Valley","Syrah",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6723","Chile","If a blast of thick but classy oak doesn't bother you, then this single-  vineyard wine comes highly recommended. It gets better with every minute of air, and along the way you get aromas of charcoal, mint, licorice and berries, which are followed by flavors of blackberry, prune cake and molasses. This modern, ripe, eminently drinkable Syrah weighs in at 14.5% alcohol.",90,28,"Cachapoal Valley","Syrah",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3
"6724","France","As befits young Pommard, this is still firm, and leaves plenty of room for development of its smoky black fruit Pinot Noir flavors. But the promise is here, with the intensity of dry tannins and structured fruit ready to power through in three or four years.",90,65,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6725","New Zealand","The 2004 vintage wasn't an easy one for Nelson Pinot Noir, and this wine reflects that. The aromas are slightly earthy and herbal, marked by tomato and beet elements, while the flavors are herbal to the point of mintiness but also fresh and appealing. Ultimately, it's an attractive effort destined for short-term drinking.",85,25,"Nelson","Pinot Noir",-41.2706319,173.2839653,3
"6726","France","Plum and smoke aromas with pure cherry and strawberry flavors. Always the steady value wine, and this one has force and power that makes you take notice. The tannins are a bit large, however, causing some drying on the finish.",84,9,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6727","France","Fruity, slightly gummy aromas signal black raspberry, plum and cherry. Indeed, there's plenty of berry fruit on the palate, that and some pepper. The finish is lively and tasty, with hints of coffee and mocha toward the very end.",84,7,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Syrah",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6728","Italy","Offers an attractive and smoky bouquet, which might indicate that it has the fullness and depth to run long. However, it's fairly compact and juicy on the palate, with cherry, berry and vanilla in control. On the money, if a bit tannic. Ageworthy, too. Imported by Remy Cointreau.",90,65,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6729","Italy","Burly, saucy and ultimately quite attractive on the nose, with leather and herbs in addition to more standard berry fruit and oak aromas. Not as chewy and soft as you might expect from a wine made by consultant du jour Carlo Ferrini; it's tannic and tight now, but exciting nonetheless. Hold through 2006. Imported by Selected Estates of Europe Ltd.",89,22,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6730","France","Tart and grassy, with definition to the nose.

"6731","Australia","A stylistic wine in that it shows the Oceania region's telltale passion fruit aromas along with those of green pepper. Quite a lot of citrus to the palate, but also a touch of green bean and pith. Dry and stony on the finish, with light but cleansing acidity. Imported by Portet Wine Selections.",89,20,"Victoria","Sauvignon Blanc",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"6732","New Zealand","Always a nice wine, the '04 succeeds by pushing steely, sharp aromas of nettles, grapefruit and citrus, and then following that up with passion fruit, grapefruit and melon flavors. Basically, it tastes as it smells, and it finishes crystal clean if a tiny bit short. Imported by Via Pacifica Imports.",89,20,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6733","Italy","Strangely this one has a nose of Italian bitters, anise and pine. It's not a warm, ripe wine. What it does give is tight, dry cherry and berry flavors with layers of complexity and intrigue. Not very woody or chewy. More old school and an enigma among so many forward, fruity compatriots.

"6734","New Zealand","Just a bare step behind Kumeu's Mate's Vineyard, the regular Chardonnay is still a special wine.

"6735","Australia","Sensationally clean on the nose, with freshwater stream minerality mixed with pure peach and pear.

"6736","Argentina","A huge amount of smoke, rubber, herbs and black fruit pour out of the nose, and that same intensity is carried onto the palate, where bright, juicy, spicy fruit is raring and ready to go. Espresso and black licorice on the finish convey power, the cornerstone of the wine. Correct and snappy; the formula for good-drinking Malbec.",89,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6737","Italy","Warm, baked and a bit vegetal, with soft plum and berry flavors. Herbal throughout, with decent feel but dry, simple flavors. If you don't mind a touch of tomato, this wine will strike a chord. Otherwise, it may not work for you.",83,9,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6738","Italy","After scoring big in 2003, this vintage seems heavy and candied, with a bit too much red licorice and raisin. Throughout it seems weighty and dull, as if the acidity got lost in transit. Not bad but more clumsy and chunky than desirable.",83,10,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6739","Italy","Seems as though the heat of 2003 sapped this wine of its vitality. The nose is soft and leathery, with sausage and vanilla aromas dominating. Tomato and root vegetables control the palate, while the finish is scrambled and stewy. Not a fresh wine.",82,24,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6740","New Zealand","This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc leans a bit toward the vegetal side of the spectrum, yet retains enough ripe character to balance the ledger. Fresh green pea and grapefruit aromas segue into intense, slightly vegetal flavors, but the underlying honey, peach and citrus notes even things out.",89,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6741","France","The wine is dominated by its dry tannins, which ride over the less exuberant fruit. Toast shows through, giving spice. Only on the finish is the juicy fruit given a chance. Like many Faiveley wines, this needs time—6 to 7 years at least.",89,40,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6742","Chile","An eye-opener; this fat, yummy late-harvest SB from the Curico Valley is a big-time surprise. Who could expect such intriguing aromas of chirimoya, peach and cinnamon? And the palate is gorged with fig, date and honey flavors. The only downside is that it's a little cloying as it warms.",89,25,"Molina","Sauvignon Blanc",-35.1164987,-71.2829759,3
"6743","New Zealand","Prototypical Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, marrying pungent red pepper and passion fruit notes with round, ripe melon flavors.

"6744","Spain","Sweet and floral, like light berries with crushed flower petals. The palate is not as comforting; it's acidic and bouncy, which fosters good flavors but a jagged, jumpy mouthfeel. You want to like this wine but the feel doesn't make it easy.",84,11,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"6745","New Zealand","A full-bodied Chard (14.9% alcohol), but one that boasts a lush softness, delivering layers of toast, cinnamon and lusciously ripe peaches.

"6746","Argentina","Round and rambunctious, with aromas of leather, herbs, cherry and cassis.

"6747","France","Talcum powder, orange peel and a bit of fresh-cut grass make for a pleasant bouquet.

Imported by Vineyard Brands.",89,26,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6748","New Zealand","A riper style of SB, built around a core of passion fruit. Ripe fig and melon notes accent the strident tropical fruit, while the harmonious finish picks up hints of grapefruit.

"6749","Italy","Off the charts in almost every way. First, it's a Calabrian Chardonnay with tons of hangtime and oak. Second, it hardly resembles Chardonnay as we know it. The nose is oily, with lemon, baked corn and quince. The palate is custardy, ultra ripe and borderline over the top. Finishes in complex ways, with peach, apricot and nutmeg along with white pepper. More of a sommelier/explorer's wine.",89,36,"Southern Italy","Chardonnay",27.6745009,-82.7263505,2
"6750","New Zealand","Fine New Zealand Sauvignon, with passion fruit and a whole lot of snappy green aromas ranging from scallion and celery to green pepper and asparagus.

"6755","New Zealand","Much like here in the States, “Reserve” tends to mean oaked to within an inch of its life. This wine shows little more than toasty oak and sweet vanilla flavors, with a flourish of buttered popcorn on the finish. Some peach aromas testify to the fruit's promise, if you enjoy heavily oaked Chardonnay, you may like this one more than the rating suggests.",84,25,"Gisborne","Chardonnay",-38.662334,178.017649,2
"6756","France","A touch oaky, with burnt sugar, mint and lemon aromas. It is firm and tannic, with proper acids; the peppy palate has good blackberry and cherry fruit, and the finish is ripe. Starts fast but loses some of its appeal as the tannins mount.",84,10,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6757","France","An attractive, red-fruited, jammy wine, named after one of the top vineyard sites in Saint-Joseph. It is full of ripe, bright tones, attractive acidity and strawberry fruits.

"6758","France","Surprisingly, considering the importance of Guigal in the region, this is the first time the producer has made a Crozes-Hermitage.

There are even tannins to give it structure and concentration.",89,15,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"6759","France","Perhaps the most classically styled of these Chablis from Moreau is the Vaucopin, which features zesty lemon and lime aromas allied to crisp pear and green apple flavors.

"6760","France","Named after owner Philippe Desmeure's son, this has a new wood dominated wine, but also with dusty tannins and ripe, black fruit flavors.

"6763","France","Dark and tough, this shows considerable wood at this early stage. Like many Faiveley wines, it is tough and tannic when young, with a dry core.

Strong-boned and ripe, this will go with almost any kind of red-friendly food—from pizza and burgers to steak and lasagna.",89,15,"Choapa Valley","Syrah",-31.8040841,-71.0022311,3
"6766","Chile","Rich barrel aromas control the nose, and the offshooting toast, vanilla and roasted nut scents are familiar and controlled. The flavors are of tempered citrus and nectarine, while the finish has a creamy character along with a breeze of the tropics. Smooth and round mouthfeel.",89,21,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"6767","New Zealand","This wine, a partly charitable endeavor aimed at furthering the educations of top Hawke's Bay students, is rather dark and earthy. Roasted meat and coffee notes, with some modest cola accents, aren't easily accessible, and it finishes with charred tomato flavors.",84,20,"Hawke's Bay","Pinot Noir",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"6768","Chile","With some rubber, prune and earth, the nose is well put together. A second act of blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors is endearing, while the dark, woodsy finish is masculine, leaving a leftover espresso character. A touch heavy and awkward, but packs power.

"6771","Chile","The citrus and grapefruit aromas are pretty standard, but the wine really comes to life on the palate, delivering zesty citrus, fresh-cut asparagus and even some minerality. Anisette, grapefruit and tangerine notes create an interesting finish. For the money, one of the best Sauvignons in Chile. Imported by Margron Skoglund.",88,8,"Colchagua Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"6772","Italy","Tight, with briar, leather and smoke aromas, along with plum and cherry. The palate on this one seems a bit jumpy, with live-wire fruit and bright acidity. So it's interesting that the finish carries some coconut, vanilla and sweet butter flavors. Needs a couple of years to knit together.

"6774","New Zealand","Tastes just like spring, with hints of delicate pear and apple blossoms on the nose, followed by green-apple flavors.

"6775","New Zealand","Nicely balanced and harmonious, with toast and yellow fruits mingling easily on the nose before giving way to pineapple and melon flavors that seem to have no sharp edges.

"6776","New Zealand","Pencarrow is Palliser's second label, which helps explain this wine's lack of body; presumably the richer lots went into the Palliser Estate bottling (not yet tasted). That said, it offers pretty cherry and herb flavors and a lingering finish.",84,20,"Martinborough","Pinot Noir",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3

"6778","Italy","Here is a rock-solid Cabernet embellished by a delicate aromatic embroidery that gives its Piedmont origins away. Dark ruby in color, the nose is perfectly seamless with ripe fruit nuances at the core and generous notes of asphalt, resin and blackberry. The tannins and structure are solid and the wine's enduring persistence can be counted in long, delicious minutes.",94,224,"Piedmont","Cabernet Sauvignon",45.0522366,7.5153885,3
"6779","Chile","Mildly candied and medicinal on the nose, but ripe across the palate. Berry and cassis flavors are supported by firm, stocky tannins.

"6781","Chile","Fairly oaky,  at first, but as it airs out and settles, it shows generous berry fruit as well as chocolate, caramel and mocha.

"6782","Chile","Dense purple in color, with bold aromas of coconut, chocolate, mint and wild berries. Don't expect an overly fat Syrah. The wine has body, extract, chewy berry fruit and tannin, but it also has bouncy acidity that almost tilts it toward choppy. With food, however, it will more than do the trick. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",88,20,"Peumo","Syrah",-34.3963392,-71.1700793,3
"6783","New Zealand","Lighter than most Marlborough 2005 Pinot Noirs, but this still packs plenty of flavor. It's a snappy, fresh Pinot with slightly peppery notes that call to mind pepper-dusted cherries. Finishes crisp and clean.",84,16,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6784","New Zealand","Disappointingly light in weight, this is nonetheless a pretty wine, featuring modest cherry and cola elements backed by leathery, mushroomy notes. Nothing flashy, but it should partner well with farm-raised venison or other mild game.",84,20,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6785","France","Pepper, mint and plum aromas, followed by heavy cherry and pepper flavors on the palate. And it's here that green pepper sneaks into the picture. And it's here to stay, as evidenced on the finish, which is leafy and green. —",83,9,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6786","France","Lots of oak on the nose, and for that matter, throughout. The wine tastes of lemon, vanilla and wood resin, while the creamy finish deals even more oak. Texture and richness are not a problem, but the wood runs roughshod over the mild, base-level fruit.",83,10,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Chardonnay",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6787","New Zealand","Heavy oak and tart berries come together in this modest effort. Taken individually, the parts of this wine are impressive, boasting bright berries, coffee and chocolate, but they fail to complely harmonize, leaving one wondering what might have been.",83,26,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"6789","France","The floral and lavender notes make the nose pretty, and the bright purple color indicates that it's young and ready. On the palate, big cherry and plum fruit is amplified by very high acidity. And the finish is tart and piercing.",83,7,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6790","New Zealand","Lean and razor-sharp, this wine is best suited for simply prepared or raw shellfish. Melon and green pepper aromas and asparagus and tart grapefruit flavors will accent the sweet brininess of fresh oysters.",83,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"6791","Italy","Seductive, succulent and hedonistic. This 77% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot blend is incredibly forthcoming and ready to drink immedi ately thanks to its rich toasted notes, chocolate fudge, blackberry, leather, tobacco, menthol and herbal aromas. There's a ton of vanilla and sweet spice on the velvety finish and melted chocolate on the close.",94,80,"Veneto","Cabernet Sauvignon",45.4414662,12.3152595,3
"6792","Italy","This is a delightfully chewy, extracted and penetrating wine that oozes blackness: Black licorice, black fruit, resin, slate, charcoal and chalkboard grow in intensity with each swirl. A very intense, modern wine that sees 18 months of oak aging for taut tannins and a supple, velvety mouthfeel. Would pair well with aged cheeses or grilled meats.",93,52,"Central Italy","Cabernet Sauvignon",41.87194,12.56738,3
"6793","Italy","A very exciting wine with amazing elegance and linearity that delivers intense aromas of licorice, menthol, toast and pressed blackberry.

"6794","Chile","This is true Casablanca Valley Sauvignon Blanc from one of the pioneers in the region. It hits with piercing, almost sweaty aromas of citrus, celery and nettles, and that nose yields to grassy and tropical flavors that are intense, balanced and slightly complex. A terroir wine for $11? Not bad at all.",88,11,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3

"6797","Spain","Brawny plum and blackberry aromas feature notes of bacon, rubber and leather, all of which lead you to expect big, ripe flavors. But the news is, those flavors aren't anywhere to be found. The profile is tangy and lean, with sharp berry notes. Quick and simple on the finish, with aggressive acidity and tannins.",83,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"6799","Spain","After a couple of vintages of really raving about this Merlot, the '02, from a cool, wet vintage, just isn't that great. The nose is dominated by rhubarb and sharpness, while the palate offers peppery flavors and a rough feel. Plenty of olive on the finish brings ripeness into question.",82,18,"Northern Spain","Merlot",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6800","France","Cherry, plum and earth aromas lead into a tart, lean palate that struggles to offer more than a modicum of cherry and cassis flavors. The finish is sweet and spicy, which makes for an odd, not terribly appealing combination.",82,8,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6801","France","Berry aromas come in front of a tart pie cherry and rhubarb palate. The feel is tight and acidic, so it lacks for mouthfeel and cries out for food. As a bistro or supermarket buy it offers the most potential.",82,10,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4

"6803","France","Sweet aromas of leather and caramel seem murky and tired. The palate comes without snap, and that's despite some plum and raspberry flavors. The finish is lean and basic, and overall it's a simple wine that doesn't really taste much like Syrah.",82,8,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Syrah",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6804","France","Big but murky; there just isn't much focus to this leathery, full-fruit bruiser that seems to draw its energy from a powerful beam of acidity that runs through the center of things. Short on balance and charm, but big on extract and tannins.",81,9,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6805","France","Spicy, peppery aromas yield to tomato but not much fruit. The palate is sour, with tart plum and cherry. And the finish is equally lean and tart. High acids and not much fruit equals a lower-end wine.",81,7,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"6806","Italy","The appellation isn't well known but based on the current line of Salustri reds we can say that Sangiovese from Montecucco in Tuscany has its merits.

"6807","Italy","Takes a while to rev up, but once it gets going it can't be stopped. Beautifully ripe and defined across the palate, with rich black fruit on level one and licorice and vanilla on level two. Finishes long, smooth and spicy, with concentration throughout. Probably our favorite Luce to date.",92,75,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6808","Italy","This wine takes a modern approach to Brunello that is instantly recognized by its penetrating aromas of smoke and toasted oak that will surely relax with a few more years of cellar aging. Chewy tannins, fresh berry flavors and good length characterize the oak-driven mouthfeel.",88,85,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6809","Australia","The outlook at De Bortoli's Yarra Valley winery is—dare it be said—more European in focus, fashioning wines that de-emphasize primary fruit in favor of terroir and texture. This Chardonnay is a good example, lacking overt fruit but showcasing mealy, leesy notes, a welcoming custardy texture and a lingering, minerally finish.",88,29,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2

"6811","Spain","Bold in color, with a stewy nose that oozes raisin and licorice. The palate is heavy, with bacon and reduced berry flavors. Flat and a touch burnt late, and in general it's in dire need of an infusion of acidity.",82,12,"Northern Spain","Syrah",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6812","Spain","The bouquet mixes bramble and berry notes, which turn rougher and more vegetal as time passes. The palate is peppery and light, with just adequate cherry and berry flavors. A light, distant wine with some similarities to Beaujolais Nouveau.",82,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6813","Italy","A wine that plays the finesse card like an ace: Elegant fragrances of blackberry, clove, cinnamon, toasted nuts and smoky oak spice are woven tightly together without ever being overstated.

"6814","Italy","Each spring, Sicily is covered with bushes of wild fennel and if you pay close attention you can smell its pungent fragrance on this 100% Cabernet. You'll also get generous notes of sage, green herb, red cherry, exotic spice, smoke, vanilla and toasted almond.

"6815","Italy","Imagine a spot of green, such as a fava bean, wrapped tight with aromas of leafy spinach, Indian spice, tree bark, tobacco and plum and that's what is delivered beautifully to the nose. There is also a delicate balance of flavors in the mouth followed by dry, dusty tannins.",91,24,"Central Italy","Cabernet Sauvignon",41.87194,12.56738,3
"6816","Italy","Oily and rich, yet smooth, deep and woodsy. In a word, it has it all. The tight palate offers ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors, while the finish is seductively secure, with chocolate and truffle notes. It still has a fair amount of wood on it, but that stretches out the finish. Will cellar well for another four or five years.",91,75,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6817","Italy","This lovely Tuscan Cabernet is blended with 10% Merlot and aged two years in French oak to render a softer, velvet-like wine that is an absolute joy to drink. The aromas are deep and penetrating and include sweet milk chocolate, cherry berry, leather, coffee and tobacco. The wine makes an excellent impression in the mouth with a long tail of roasted espresso bean and candied cherry.",91,68,"Tuscany","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6818","Chile","Rich and ripe but a bit generic. Even if it doesn't show a lot of varietal character—namely spice, leather and bacon—it makes up for it with lip-smacking blackberry, black currant and chocolate flavors. There's no denying that it's New World Syrah.",88,20,"Rapel Valley","Syrah",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"6819","Chile","A fair amount of molten earth, leather, black olive and wood smoke blends nicely with solid berry and cassis aromas, while the palate dishes up berry fruit, vanilla and a hint of herbal character and leather.

"6820","Italy","An interesting nose, if somewhat disjointed: Peach, melon, yellow fruit, graham cracker, eucalyptus, sweet flowers, nuts and mint snaps come though, layer after layer. Thanks to its crisp acidity, it would pair well with ravioli in a cream sauce and Parmigiano cheese.",87,20,"Tuscany","Chardonnay",43.7710513,11.2486208,2
"6821","Spain","Brambly red fruit, leather and a strong whiff of dill pickle create a less than welcoming nose, which is backed by tart red fruit that carries a roasted overtone. Oaky and tomatoey throughout, with a lean mouthfeel.",81,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"6823","Spain","Jammy and sweet on the nose, like a jar of strawberry preserves. The palate, however, is light and tart, with burnt berry flavors. Finishes peppery and short, with little to latch onto.",80,10,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"6824","France","As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years.",96,175,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

"6826","France","This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years.",95,600,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6827","Italy","Round and minty up front, with stylish dark-fruit aromas and a touch of char. An intense wine with deep cherry, toast and coffee flavors.

Should age nicely through 2010.",91,35,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6828","Italy","It's almost criminal to taste Sassicaia before its prime. The 2003 vintage should be ready after 2010. A blend of 85% Cab Sauvignon and 15% Cab Franc that aged 24 months in barrique, notes of cassis, exotic spice, menthol and green olive come through despite the hot vintage. It's powerful in the mouth with crispness and refined tannins.",91,180,"Tuscany","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"6829","New Zealand","Full-bodied yet supple, this darkly colored Pinot marries a slight leafiness with black cherry fruit.

"6830","Chile","Definitely on the ripe side, but a very pleasing wine. This is a low-acid wine that obviously caught a lot of sun in the vineyard, thus it goes soft on the tannins and light on the bite.

"6834","France","It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well.",95,113,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6835","France","This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate.",95,250,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6836","France","This is the smallest of the grand crus of Puligny-Montrachet, a mere 8.6 acres.

"6839","France","While the wood aromas dominate, on the palate, there is a much richer, rounder character.

"6841","France","Full, but structured, this is a wine that shows a serious side to Meursault. It layers fine stone-fruit flavors with crisp apple skins and some fresh toast and butter. It should improve over 5 years.",93,68,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6842","France","This delicious, crisp wine reveals the more delicate side of Chardonnay. Coming from one of the high vineyards in La Grande Montagne of Chassagne, it has pure, elegant freshness, supplemented by a touch of vanilla.",93,85,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6843","New Zealand","Classic aromas of black cherry and plum are framed by dried spices and vanilla, adding some cedar and mocha flavors on the palate. The mouthfeel is crisp and taut, finishing tart and fresh, without the velvety richness of the best examples, but it's a solid effort.",87,32,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"6844","New Zealand","This is a light, easy-drinking bottling from actor Sam Neill's property, offering slightly herbal and peppery aromas backed by just enough cherry fruit. Crisp and clean on the finish.",87,28,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"6845","New Zealand","A pretty, pure Pinot, with lovely strawberry and cherry flavors backed by just hints of mushroom, tree bark and dried spices. It's light- to medium-bodied, with a silky, elegant finish. Fairly priced for the quality; drink over the next couple of years.",87,22,"Nelson","Pinot Noir",-41.2706319,173.2839653,3
"6846","New Zealand","Other vintages of this wine have been even more impressive, but Clearview's 2006 is still atypically rich for an unwooded Chardonnay. Touches of clove and brown sugar accent bold citrus and pear flavors, ending with a flourish of lime custard. Drink now.",87,28,"Hawke's Bay","Chardonnay",-39.1089867,176.7416374,2
"6847","Chile","A first pass indicates that this Cab might be a little raisiny and flat, so it comes as a nice surprise to find out that the palate, while soft, has a poke or two of tannin and good flavors of cassis, prune and blackberry. It's definitely a weighty, modern-styled wine that pours on the mocha and chocolate late in the game. Drink now.",87,30,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6848","Austria","This is a massive, brooding Riesling that seems to demand time in the cellar. Sweet corn, smoke and peach kernel notes mark the bouquet, while the powerful mineral flavors are accented by apple and peach. Broad and palate-coating in texture, with a long, oily finish, this is undeniably impressive.",93,30,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3
"6849","France","You can almost taste the stones that give this vineyard its name. This is a mineral, firm, tight wine that demands time to develop. The fruit is there, with flavors of white currants, but wait for this wine—at least four years.",93,72,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6850","France","An intense, well-balanced wine with deliciously ripe yet lively green-fruit flavors. The wood is integrated, providing a cushioning richness to what is already a delicious wine. Girardin owns 3.7 acres in Les Folatières.",93,83,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6851","France","Full-bodied, big-hearted, ripe and joyful, this is a welcoming, enticing wine. Flavors of green plums, nutmeg and fresh citrus are part of the pleasure. But so are the open, generous, almost opulent flavors.",93,89,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6852","Argentina","For the second straight year, Chacayes scores major points among serious Argentine wines competing for the world's attention. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is deep, dark and seductive. It's all about compact, intense fruit supported by hefty tannins. Very nice and perfectly ripe. Hold a couple of years for best results.",92,75,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6853","France","Pierre Morey also runs a small negociant business, Morey Blanc, specializing in whites from Meursault. This is one of the wines, a delicious, fresh, crisp wine that's packed with light, airy flavors of green apples and citrus.",92,120,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6854","France","Coming from the largest of the Puligny premier crus, this is a big, bold, ripe wine.  Still structured at this young stage, but generous and packed with green plum and lime flavors. The wood gives tannins but doesn't dominate.",92,70,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6855","New Zealand","This is a very clean, fruit-driven rendering of Sauvignon Blanc, with bright pineapple and citrus flavors that are dressed up a little by almost floral hints of baby powder and lavender. Drink now.",87,25,"Martinborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3
"6856","Chile","If you temper expectations, this New World Chardonnay will fit the bill. It delivers modest pear and vanilla aromas as well as ample sweetness on the palate, but it has good acidity and balance, thus the creamy, baked marshmallow flavors that often mar Chilean Chard are largely absent. Drink now.",87,11,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"6857","Chile","Although 2006 has been replaced by 2007, this is a well-oiled wine with nice green-fruit aromas backed by hints of pineapple and lime. The palate shows a wealth of lime, lemon and fresh cucumber, while the mouthfeel is at first electric before running steady until the end.",87,10,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"6858","Australia","This easy-drinking rosé offers bright aromas of strawberries and watermelon, maybe even a touch of bubblegum. It's medium-bodied, but seems to gain freshness on the finish, where the berry flavors come on stronger. Drink now.",87,18,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"6859","Chile","This is a step up from previous efforts for this winery. This SB shows enticing aromas of lemon pastry, melon and vanilla, while the palate is plush but still fresh with white peach and apple flavors. Good length and balance; drink-now special. Imported by Vinecrest Co.",87,10,"Maule Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"6860","France","In the fat, buttery style of white Burgundy, this wine, with its malolactic flavors and its vanilla flavors, would appeal immediately to California Chardonnay lovers. Except that it also has elegance: a hint of steel and a touch of acidity to temper the tropical fruits.",92,70,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6861","France","From the Bouchard domaine, this wine is soft and ripe. There is some structure and firm acidity, but that's secondary to the luscious flavors that roll around the mouth. The wood broadens but also gives extra complexity to the wine.",92,84,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6862","France","Chenevottes is situated high up on the Chassagne-Montrachet slope, above the grand cru vineyards. With its fat, ripe butter and coconut milk character, this wine offers an immediately appealing style. But there is a hint of ageability in its layers of serious wood and structure.",92,49,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6863","France","Still tasting young, and not yet showing all its power, this is still an impressive wine. It is firm and structured, with citrus and mineral flavors dominating the concentrated fruit. The wood shows through via a warm spiciness. This will certainly age for 5 years or more.",92,103,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6864","France","This shows the more racy, fresh side of Meursault. It's a wine that dances and jumps around the mouth. Light but still full of delicious green fruits. The wood is there, but it's such a delicate touch.",92,84,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6865","France","Big, intense and ripe, this wine has great flavors of ripe apples, almonds and honey from the malolactic fermentation. It is poised, elegant and powerful—a balance that is the best of many worlds. From the Roux domaine, it is finely crafted and likely to age for many years.",92,75,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6866","France","Like so many Drouhin wines, this is beautifully balanced. The wood, green fruit, spice and acidity already in fine harmony. There is a richness coming from the deep soils of the vineyard. Can it age? Probably, because of the firm structure.",91,65,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6867","France","Producing some of the more refined wines of Meursault, Charmes also has the right amount of opulence. Louis Latour's wine brings out all the richness and ripeness; soft, generous and full-bodied and leavened with spicy wood flavors.",91,75,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6868","Argentina","Ripe and smooth, with hints of molasses, toast, and vanilla as well as mulberry and blackberry. The wine runs sweet but masculine, with chocolate as the prime secondary flavor. Finishes long and broad, with supple tannins. Made from 8-year-old vines. Drink now through 2015.",91,50,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6869","France","More steely than some Meursault, this layers wood and mineral flavors with a fine structure and tastes of apple skins and nutmeg. This wine could age 3–4 years, but it is already delicious.",91,45,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6870","Chile","Plum and other red-fruit aromas have a mild herbal, leafy edge, while the fresh and fairly smooth palate blends plum, berry and olive flavors. The wine is a bit leafy and herbal, but it's round and healthy, with a solid feel to it. Imported by Racke USA, Inc.",86,15,"Central Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"6871","Australia","A blend of fruit from five different vineyards throughout the valley, this is a pretty, lightweight Pinot Noir. Delicate strawberry fruit wraps around a core of earth and forest floor, with just hints of darker berry flavors. Drink now.",86,20,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"6872","Chile","Celery and other cool-climate varietal aromas are balanced by tropical fruit notes; the weighty palate plays host to apple, lime and grapefruit flavors. As the wine airs out, it turns more to capsicum, even touching on vegetal, fitting the emerging profile for coastal Chilean SB.",86,18,"San Antonio","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.5922807,-71.6055123,3
"6873","France","Blagny is a small hamlet just up the hill from Les Perrières. This is a cooler spot, and the wine shows this with its structure and flavors of fresh green fruits over generous portions of wood. A wine that should age for more than 5 years.",91,48,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6874","France","From the domaine of Pierre Morey, who is also cellarmaster at Domaine Leflaive. Like at Leflaive, he works his vines biodynamically. This is a layered wine; the pure, crisp fruit partnering with light toast flavors and a poised and structured apple-skin aftertaste.",91,80,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6875","France","Ripe, open and packed with melon and tropical fruit flavors, this wine is already showing enticing drinkability. Its fresh, ripe fruits is layered with some mineral character and an under-cushion of wood.",90,65,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6876","Chile","A blend of citric and tropical aromas is nice, while the palate is right for the most part as it deals ripe green apple and lime flavors. There's a slight creaminess to the feel, but the flavors are all zesty citrus and such. Imported by Racke USA, Inc.",86,15,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"6877","Australia","A bit darker and oakier than the finesse-filled 2005 version, with black cherry flavors that finish crisp and firm on the finish. Give it another six months of bottle age, then drink it over the next five years.",86,20,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"6878","France","A blend of Pinot Noir with César, an ancient variety of the region west of Chablis. This gives a slightly foxy character to the wine, the tannins smoky and tight. It is definitely firm, with red berries and good amounts of acidity.",86,30,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6879","France","Citrus and white peach aromas promise a tropical SB. And that's what the palate offers, with rich peach and apricot flavors, with plenty of fresh acidity, almonds and ripe fruit.",86,10,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6880","Argentina","Lovely up front, with lavender, licorice and pepper accenting live-wire blackberry aromas. Jammy and extracted in the mouth, with pure berry flavors. This is a mountain of a wine that doesn't pull its punches. Expect weight, tannin and extract but also a lot of flavor.",90,19,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6881","France","Rich, buttery and forward, but with a fine streak of minerality to give structure and interest. The wood gives a spicy character to the wine, but it doesn't dominate the rich burst of fruit.",90,57,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6882","France","A Meursault-based domaine that has progressed rapidly in quality under Philippe Ballot. This Genevrières is a rich, young wine that promises an open, ripe, wood-layered series of flavors in 2 years.",90,79,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6883","France","A full, rounded wine with yellow fruit and citrus flavors lying over vanilla and toast flavors. This rich wine is ready to drink despite a good touch of minerality to finish.",90,85,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6884","France","Round and generous, but with a mineral heart that gives structure to this full wine. It has weight, dense fruit and delicious peach and nectarine flavors. The structure suggests this Morgeot has the potential to age.",90,59,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6885","Chile","Smooth and toasty on the nose, with a lot of barrel-driven vanilla. The palate offers depth and fairly tame banana and sweet tropical fruit flavors. Texture is an attribute, and there's just enough juicy acidity to prop up the wine's heavier nature. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",86,17,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"6886","Chile","Very aggressive on the nose, with penetrating aromas of menthol, olive and herbal fruit. That gentle but obvious herbal character persists on the palate, where cassis and plum flavors never come across as sweet or expressive. Finishes woody, with a touch of chocolate, while the mouthfeel is a bit grabby and tannic.",86,39,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6887","New Zealand","Fresh and appealing, this unoaked offering from Te Awa doesn't feature a lot of complexity, but pleases for its straightforward pineapple and citrus flavors.",86,20,"Hawke's Bay","Chardonnay",-39.1089867,176.7416374,2
"6888","France","Powerful, intense wood aromas dominate this wine initially. But on the palate, there are also fruit flavors that push at the wood, giving delicious apricot,  white fruits and some honey to go along with the vanilla tastes.",90,42,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6889","France","This is a great Meursault that's full of round, ripe, generous fruit. It's packed with yellow fruit and kiwi flavors. Revel in its richness. This wine comes from Bouchard's own vines.",90,36,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6890","Argentina","A modern-styled Malbec even though it comes from 33-year-old vines grown in a cool subsection of Mendoza. The aromas are warm, smoky and earthy as they set the stage for bright boysenberry and currant flavors. Balanced and sturdy, with fine natural acidity. Drink now through 2015.",90,50,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6891","France","Very rich, ripe and packed with new-wood flavors, this is somewhat flashy, but it's still delicious to drink. Sit back and enjoy.",90,69,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6892","Argentina","Subtle and smooth from start to finish. The aromas are sly but sturdy, with mocha and blackberry sticking out. The flavor profile is pure black fruit with underlayers of spice and chocolate. A ripe, really good example of approachable Malbec.",90,15,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6893","France","A spicy, nutty wine that shows some of the Meursault broadness but also offers some subtlety, with ripe fruits layered with more complex wood and herb flavors. This could age well over the next 2–3 years.",90,40,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6894","Chile","Mouthfeel is a vital component of any wine, and this one has a very hard, tannic feel to it. The nose is reduced and compact, with sweet cherry and cassis aromas. But as stated, the palate is like nails. It's literally sharp and has poke, and in the end there's nothing to indicate that age will tame the beast. Imported by Orvino Imports.",85,25,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"6895","Australia","Marked by slightly herbal, tomato-y elements, this wine is nevertheless well put together, with delicate fruit flavors tinged by mushroomy notes. Offers authentic Pinot flavors at a reasonable price.",85,18,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"6896","Chile","Fairly sweet berry and cassis aromas mix with some heat and alcohol, and then things settle down as bright but mildly rubbery cherry, cassis and raspberry fruit takes over. It's a little astringent and stretched out, but it doesn't try to do too much and thus is easy end enjoyable. Imported by Orvino Imports.",85,13,"Molina","Cabernet Sauvignon",-35.1164987,-71.2829759,3
"6897","Argentina","Salentein, after a few years of finding its way in Tupungato, has hit the mark with this tobacco- and spice-driven Syrah. The bouquet is ripe, with a hint of prune and earth, while the palate is full, juicy and full of berries, vanilla and coconut. Modern and woody, but satisfying.",90,19,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6898","France","This is a lively, fresh wine with good acidity, a touch of toast under the fruit and a great burst of energy and zing in the aftertaste.",89,53,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6899","Argentina","Granular aromas of berry, earth and tar precede a vivacious, rather deep palate of lumbering, chewy black-fruit flavors. It feels right, sits right, and tastes right while leaving chocolate and nutmeg on the finish. Fairly classy and definitely well made. Only 400 cases made.",89,18,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6900","Argentina","Meaty and slightly savory, with roasted aromas and spice notes mixed in. The palate is rich and ripe, with blackberry and fudge-based flavors. It's also rather different than the average Malbec: the flavor profile doesn't just feature jammy berry fruit. There's smoked meat, raisin and other interesting things going on.",89,18,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6901","Chile","Spicy, dry, red-fruit aromas set you up for a palate that's offering only medium ripeness and not a ton of forward fruit. This is soft-styled with some buttery oak and limited follow through on the finish. Doesn't live up to its gran reserva billing but isn't offensive, either.",85,16,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6902","Chile","A direct reflection of Chile's cool and wet '02 vintage. This has an underdeveloped side to it; it seems short, tight and striving for a level of ripeness and balance it's not about to achieve. That it comes from good enough vines and good enough people assures that it's not a bad wine. But the 2003 is quite a bit better.",85,44,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"6903","Chile","Pungent and citric, which tells you right away that it's Casablanca. Very tropical and green on the palate, with quite a bit in common with Sauvignon Blanc. But it's fresh and lively, and it can't be accused of being lazy. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.",85,18,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"6904","France","Haut-Poitou, to the south of the Loire Valley, specializes in fresh, crisp Sauvignon Blanc like this herbal, grassy wine, dominated by grapefruit, green berries and some sage. There's a cool structure to it, leaving freshness.",85,10,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6905","Chile","For a higher-end wine from San Pedro, we'd like to see a little more in the way of focus and less blast-furnace oak. The wine initially smells like a hickory factory, and even when that woodiness calms down there are rough-hewn tannins and an herbal core identity. On the plus side, it does get better and better with airing.",85,20,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6906","France","Aromas of toast dominate this wine, but the palate is better balanced with citrus and apple flavors. But it does need time for the wood to calm and to integrate. Don't confuse this Machard de Gramont with the one owned by Bertrand Machard de Gramont—this is Burgundy.",89,47,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6907","Argentina","A wine of character. The bouquet takes time to unfold, dealing earthy aromas and desert sage. Flavors of black cherry and cassis are firm and forceful, while the tannins are pronounced. A little clumsy and rugged now; should be better in a year or so.",89,19,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6908","Argentina","Savory and ripe. The nose starts with earthy fruit combined with leather and mushroom. The palate is deep and full, with notes of brandied cherries, sautéed porcini and chocolate. Fades a bit on the finish, leaving coffee and bitter chocolate. Very good, with just the slightest herbal character.",89,18,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6909","France","This wine shows crisp citric fruit allied to layers of spicy wood. Then it opens with some ripe white fruits and thirst-quenching acidity. It should age well over 3–4 years. The Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is in the southern part of the appellation.",89,60,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6910","Argentina","Mildly dusty and herbal on the nose, but not the least bit green or weedy. Flavors of tobacco, cassis and blackberry carry accents of cedar and vanilla, while the soft tannins make for a full, easy mouthfeel. Aged 18 months in French oak but it's not overly toasty or dark.",89,35,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6911","France","A village Meursault, but one which has been treated like a cru, with layers of ripe wood balancing  the pure green- and white-fruit flavors. This is ready to drink now as it is well balanced and deliciously fresh.",89,68,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6912","France","Round, white pear flavors, with some tannic texture, this is a simple, fresh, crisp Sancerre, favoring pink grapefruit and sage, and touched by a lightly sweet edge.",84,29,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"6913","Chile","An oily and thick style of SB. It captures Leyda's coastal climate almost too much, resulting in green, lightly vegetal aromas and flavors. There's some pickle and bell pepper, and it seems underdeveloped throughout.",84,16,"Leyda Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,3
"6914","France","Very light, this is full of fresh raspberry with a sharp acidity. Ready to drink.",84,18,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"6915","New Zealand","The flagship wine from actor Sam Neill is a bit of a disappointment, lacking fruit and vibrance. There's plenty of mushroomy complexity, spice and forest-floor nuances, but the fruit in this sample showed signs of drying out prematurely. Drink up.",84,50,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"6916","France","A wood-dominated wine, with spice and toast. The citrus and white fruit element is very much subdued. The aftertaste continues on the same theme—dry tannins from the wood. Give it a few months and the balance should be better.",88,48,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6917","France","This is an enjoyable wine, open and soft, with crisp white and yellow fruits, a touch of citrus and a touch of wood to give it all shape. Drink now.",88,54,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6918","Argentina","An earthy specimen, with leather and crude-oil aromas blended with dark fruit. The palate is extracted and chewy, with berry and cherry flavors that should please. With its body and thickness, it registers as a modern-styled red.",88,14,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6919","France","A lively, rich, very fresh and crisp wine that has some of the buttery character of Meursault. This is open, easy and generous.",88,43,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6920","Chile","Hits with a subdued perfume of light berries, bramble and mushroom, but turns rather sharp and sheering on the palate. Calling it tangy and racy is almost an understatement; this wine is overtly snappy and acidic, with sharp raspberry flavors and plenty of length and drive due to the strong acidity.",84,18,"Casablanca Valley","Syrah",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6921","Chile","Soft and a bit vegetal on the nose, with canned bean aromas sitting in front of plump melon, banana and bell pepper flavors. Despite the current vintage, this wine has a heavy, flatter personality that makes it hard for it to climb the ladder. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.",84,13,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"6922","Chile","The price for Floresta has never been higher and frankly the wine has never been more green and tough. For starters, 2004 was a cool year in Chile, and that's evidenced here. The wine has a near-vegetal streak on the nose and palate, and the fruit is tart while the feel is hard.",84,55,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"6923","France","A lively, fresh and relatively light wine, showing the soft and easy side of Charmes. It is ready to drink but without the opulence of some wines from this vineyard.",88,80,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6924","France","This soft wine shows  fresh, easy acidity and pineapple flavors. The wine opens fully in the mouth; it's like a sunburst of fruit and citrus, with just a touch of wood.",88,46,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6925","France","Roux Père et Fils, based in Saint-Aubin, has done much to enhance the reputation of the appellation. This wine shows the potential of the ripe fruit that can be produced in a year such as 2004. Perhaps the winemaker was carried away by new wood, but that should tone down in a year.",88,28,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6926","France","This wine hasn't quite settled down yet. There is still some rusticity to it, which at the moment detracts from what is obviously rich fruit. Give it a year.",88,72,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6927","Chile","Warm and toasty, with heavy aromas of vanilla and nuts along with a soft, creamy, low-acid palate to match. The wine pours on the banana, oak and vanilla flavors before turning flat on the back end. Ripe and friendly but not much power.",84,13,"Colchagua Valley","Chardonnay",-34.6761419,-71.097317,2
"6928","Chile","This is a real heavyweight. At 15.4% alcohol it tastes and smells like Port, and it has a flat and chewy palate of raisin, baked black fruit and licorice candy. Basically, there's just no edge or balance to this mammoth, overripe fruit ball.",83,18,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"6929","France","A fresh, light, crisp wine with some good mineral overtones layered with toast. While it doesn't have great complexity, this is an attractive, citrusy wine that's ready to drink now.",88,67,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6930","Austria","Pungent and herbal, with grassy notes that overlay bright lime fruit and a solid mineral base. Structured, this could age nicely over the next 5–8 years, much like a good Bordeaux blanc.",88,32,"Styria","Sauvignon Blanc",47.3593442,14.4699827,3
"6931","Argentina","Starts with coffee and burnt toast, and next comes deep blueberry, black plum and spice flavors. Begins racy on the palate and then mellows into cushy softness. Good in its depth of flavor, with chewy tannins.",87,19,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6932","New Zealand","This cleanly made wine features white grapefruit, pineapple and herb aromas and flavors, but seems a trifle soft and lacking zest. Drink up. Imported by Oceania Wine Group.",83,16,"Hawke's Bay","Sauvignon Blanc",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"6933","Austria","A bracingly acidic dry Riesling, this starts out with slatey, smoky aromas and hints of apple and clover, then adds crisp green-apple and grapefruit flavors. Finishes dry and tart, accented by grapefruit zest.",87,23,"Kremstal","Riesling",47.9271368,14.080665,3
"6934","France","This village wine is full of ripe, open tropical fruits and an attractive caramel touch. The whole is wrapped in clean acidity and a delicious lift to the finish.",87,50,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6935","Argentina","Violet in color, with chunky, ripe aromas of earth and berries that win you over. Structured and full, but also dry and layered. The fruit comes across ripe, while on the finish everything folds into a nice little square. Not spectacular but very easy to drink and enjoy.",87,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"6936","Argentina","Fans of ripe, round Chardonnays should look no further than this. The apple, pear and melon flavors are nice and sweet, with hints of butter and toast backing them up. Good on the palate, with body and texture. An easy drinker.",87,11,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"6937","New Zealand","Herbal and short, this Sauvignon Blanc comes from a producer better known for its red wines. Sweet green pea and grapefruit aromas give way to citrusy flavors.",82,14,"Hawke's Bay","Sauvignon Blanc",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"6938","France","This is the epitome of great Chablis, with minerality, initial austerity and coiled power. It is a dense, tense wine, structured with both toasty tannins and green fruits that shine out of all this concentration. Age for 7–10 years.",96,85,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6939","France","Often seen as the easiest of the grand crus because of its richness, this shows more power due to the vintage. There is some tightness to the ripe structure, with white currant, pear skin and spice flavors. Finishes with sweet acidity.",95,85,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6940","France","This flagship wine is Laroche's selection from the best wines of Les Blanchots. At this stage, it is young, its aromas mineral and crisp, but its future generous richness is very evident. It will be an intensely powerful expression of Chardonnay, touched by wood, and leaving great concentration. Screwcap.",94,100,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6941","France","Touched by wood, this wine is more about the huge, rich fruit flavors; the yellow peaches and mangoes are balanced with a defined citrus element. Rich, but given structure from the crisp grapefruit flesh and red apples.",93,65,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6942","France","A concentrated, hugely rich wine with lively caramel and toast aromas, followed by ripe fruits. It is generous and open, with apricots and nectarines giving richness, while kiwi gives the green, crisp character. The aftertaste is all minerality. Screwcap.",93,60,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6943","Australia","There's a noticeable background herbal element to this intensely concentrated wine. Dense layers of cassis and chocolate are front and center, filling the mouth with velvety richness and finishing long. Despite the power and richness, there's a structure to match, suggesting this will improve through at least 2012 and drink well until 2020.",93,45,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6944","Australia","Made in the winery's classically savory style, this flagship Cabernet shows a touch of bricking at the rim and some maturing aromas and flavors of tobacco, cedar and earth. It's broad and mouthfilling, creamy in texture yet not obviously fruity, finishing with lush, soft tannins and a touch of hickory smoke. Drink now–2015.",93,50,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6945","Australia","Operative words to describe this wine might include seamless and harmonious. There's such wonderful integration of fruit and oak that it's difficult to pick this wine's flavor components apart—it's a whirl of cassis and cedar, yet restrained; full-bodied, rich and dense without being heavy. Long and velvety on the finish, with enough soft tannins to last it 10–15 years.",93,75,"Western Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3
"6946","France","This is an elegant, refined style of wine, with all the elements in balance. There is wood, green and white fruits, fresh acidity and repressed power. This is a Chablis style that needs aging—give it at least 5 years.",93,60,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6947","France","This tight, steely wine is austere initially, but opens up to show concentrated richness, with flavors of white currants, vivid green fruits and crisp, intense acidity. Obviously a wine that needs age—4 years at least.",93,30,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6948","France","Intensity is the keyword here: the butter, toast and ripe yellow fruits are both ripe and powerful. There's some spice, balanced with acidity, finishing so fresh, young and crisp.",93,44,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6949","Australia","From veteran winemaker John Glaetzer, this Cabernet from Langhorne Creek is something of a throwback, spending some 28 months in American oak hogsheads. Yet there's clearly enough cherry and cassis fruit to support all of the vanilla and toasted coconut, and the wine finishes long and balanced. Drink 2010–2020.",93,50,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6950","France","This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",93,59,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6951","France","This is a wine that speaks of its terroir, the chalk soil coming out in a very mineral, austere character. It has elegance, class, great style of poise, showing acidity, fresh green fruits and a need to age for at least 5 years.",93,46,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6952","France","A very vibrant, lively wine, all mineral and fresh acidity. There is some austerity  as the fruit still needs to round out; but it promises to develop well, with delicious green apple and grapefruit flavors. Keep this for 3–4 years.",92,32,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6953","France","Steeliness exemplified in wine. This is crisp and structured, complex with its green fruits, structured acidity and touch of caramel and kiwi. It's the acidity that shows at the moment; needs 4–5 years.",92,34,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6954","France","There's a luscious outer edge to this wine, with mango and peach flavors freshened with citrus. But at its dense core, it is all mineral, flinty, the wood present but certainly not dominant. It needs time, maybe 3–4 years.",92,45,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6955","France","A beautiful wine that floats its minerality, white flower aromas and white currant fruits over a foundation of toast. Freshness dominates this crisp wine, with intensity to finish.",92,44,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6956","Australia","This is a full-bodied, velvety Cab, filled with ripe fruit and gentle oaking.

"6957","France","La Chablisienne vinifies this portion of Fourchaume premier cru separately, regarding it as almost grand cru in power. It is certainly a concentrated wine, very ripe, but lined with citrus acidity, crispness and structure. At the end, though, the richness comes out.",92,34,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6958","France","Grapefruit and other citrus fruits come through the rich fruit. There is power and crispness here, along with a sense of structure from the mineral, flinty character that underlies the fruit. Hold for for 3–4 years.",92,32,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6959","Australia","Consumers who associate the Jacob's Creek brand solely with inexpensive quaffing wines should take a look at some of the company's high-end offerings, such as the St. Hugo's Cabernet. The 2003 features plenty of body, a creamy, velvety texture and bright cherry fruit. Darker notes of cassis lend depth, embellished by hints of eucalyptus, tobacco and vanilla. Drink now–2015.

"6960","Australia","Full-bodied and rich, Cape Mentelle's 2002 Cab Sauvignon is a slightly minty wine, but relies more on ripe cassis and chocolate flavors for power and weight. The silkiness of the tannins suggests only 2–3 more years are needed before this wine really hits its stride.",91,45,"Western Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3

"6962","France","Weighty, full-bodied, full of ripe yellow fruits. Here's a wine that is going to be a powerhouse, packed with intense flavors, touched by wood and a crisp edge. The aftertaste leaves minerality along with the ripe fruit.",91,65,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"6963","Australia","This wine is much more convincing than Jenke's 2005 Cabernet, reinforcing the concept that Barossa Cab typically performs better in cooler years (2002 was the coolest on record). It's still broad and mouthfilling, but the plum and cassis flavors stay this side of overripe, buttressed by plenty of smoke, vanilla and spice. Long and savory on the finish. Drink now–2015. Imported by 34th Parallel, LLC.",91,29,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6964","Australia","A big, powerful wine, but one that also manages to convey a sense of elegance, Penley's 2004 Reserve Cabernet is plummy-ripe, with chocolaty overtones and lashings of smoky oak. Yet the tanins are supple, imparting a creamy texture to this large-scaled wine. A crisp, slightly herbal note on the finish helps lighten the overall impression. Drink now–2020.",91,65,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"6966","Italy","Beautiful intensity surrounds this linear, compact and elegant Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas include berry fruit, balsamic notes, iron-earthy tones and chopped herbs.

"6967","France","With 24 acres in this premier cru vineyard, Laroche is able to produce this mineral- and grapefruit-flavored wine in good quantities. There is a touch of caramel, balanced with excellent lively acidity. A fresh but full-bodied wine that will age well over the next 2–3 years.

"6969","Australia","Full-bodied and youthfully tannic, but quite promising, this wine features a big core of cassis fruit and plenty of oak-derived embellishment. It's not herbal, but not pruny either, hitting the sweet spot between under- and overripe. Good now, but should hold through at least 2013.",90,22,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6970","Australia","An intense, well-made Cabernet, with typical mint and cassis aromas and bold flavors of black currants and vanilla.

"6971","Argentina","Since Aurelio Montes of Chile crossed the Andes three or four years ago to make Kaiken, the Ultra line—be it Malbec or Cabernet—has been a consistent performer. This vintage pours on the rich, extracted aromas of black fruit and cassis, and then follows that up with similar flavors. It's full-bodied but not necessarily a heavy wine, with sweetness and chocolate but not much nuance or complexity.

"6972","Australia","Give this wine a quick decanting prior to serving if you can, so that its lively cassis and floral components come to the fore.

"6973","Argentina","Chakana strikes again with this excellent value-priced Malbec. The nose hits firmly with smoke and rubber before settling on ripe black fruit notes.

Great depth and purity for a wine not meant to be complicated.",90,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"6975","Australia","From the team at Yalumba, this is an excellent value, delivering dark, concentrated aromas and flavors of cassis and chocolate, leavened with just a touch of mint. Finishes long, with silky tannins that should allow it to age through 2012.",90,15,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6976","Australia","A dark, earthy take on Cabernet, without the obvious cassis character that often overtakes Australian Cabs. Instead, the aromas and flavors lean toward black olive and tobacco. Tannins are fully ripe and soft, making it easy to drink now, although there's enough tart acidity for balance.",89,35,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"6982","Australia","Substantially more evolved than the 2002, the 2001 Art Series Cabernet features coffee and meat aromas and flavors that veer quickly away from primary fruit and toward savory and charred. It's medium-bodied and does show excellent length, so drink up in the near term.",89,45,"Western Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3
"6983","Argentina","Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",89,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"6987","Australia","Everything about this wine is big, from the boisterous nose of cassis, herbs and tobacco, to the bold flavors of cassis, vanilla and tobacco. The finish is long and loud, like the volume's been turned way up. Ultimately, it lacks a bit of elegance and finesse; if that emerges with aging, this rating will seem conservative.",89,65,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"6988","Argentina","Cola, blackberry and cassis dominate the bouquet, with cedar making a cameo. The palate shows no shortage of tannins, while the flavors yield to the usual suspects: cassis, black fruit, etc. To call it a young buck would be accurate.

"6990","Spain","Youthful and exuberant, with a generous blend of lead pencil, molasses and plum/berry aromas. Torres got the perfect level of ripeness and balance in this favorable vintage, and thus this is probably as good a Merlot as you're ever going to see from the Penedès. It's full and just sweet enough. Drink now through 2010.",88,16,"Catalonia","Merlot",41.5911589,1.5208624,1

"6994","Spain","Dusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors.

The palate mixes some earthy, more nuanced flavors such tree bark, baked plum and bitter chocolate; the finish is clean, stout and medium long. A good wine with pure dark fruit flavors.",88,11,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7000","Argentina","A cool quality runs through the dark-fruit bouquet, which has notes of leather and earth in reserve. The palate is forward and fruity, and it settles on the finish with a touch of plushness and a little chocolate flavor. Straightforward, and with some depth. This is a nice Argentine Tempranillo that happens to be organic.",87,10,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1
"7001","Australia","After 18 months in American oak, the first impressions of this wine are of cedar and hickory. It's medium-bodied, with plenty of dried spices and savory character, and just enough bright berry fruit to carry it off. Imported by AUSA Pacific LLC.",87,50,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7002","Australia","Nicely balanced, this is the sort of restrained Cab Sauvignon Yarra Valley can do well, with hints of mint and eucalyptus layered over cassis fruit. The texture is creamy, the tannins smooth. It's not as rich as the 2003, or a barrel sample of the 2006, but it's well crafted and harmonious.",87,17,"Victoria","Cabernet Sauvignon",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3

"7004","Australia","Consulting winemaker Ben Glaetzer has fashioned a reasonably full-bodied Cab for the Mitolo family, one that combines some superripe, verging on raisined, elements with hints of tobacco and herbs. Mint, cassis and chocolate round out the palate, finishing softly tannic. Drink now–2010.",87,20,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7005","Australia","The suggestion of brown at this wine's rim suggests a certain degree of maturity and the wine's dried-fruit flavors tend to bear that out. Leather, prune and tobacco flvors are carried by creamy tannins and a supple mouthfeel. Drink up.",87,19,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7006","Spain","Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather. The palate has some prickle and snap to it, but it settles into lively black plum and boysenberry. Finishes smooth, ripe and big, with medium length. The coupage is 80% Syrah and 20% Monastrell.",87,23,"Catalonia","Syrah",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"7007","Argentina","Leather, charred oak and mineral carry the nose, which also offers some generic black-fruit aromas. The palate is firm and tannic, thus the early session of cassis and blackberry is preferable to the tail-end notes of buttery oak, tannin and burnt coffee.",87,45,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7008","Argentina","There's a sweet center to the bouquet, but surrounding it are more complex notes of mushroom, rubber and roast meat. The palate features ripe, clean blackberry and cassis flavors, while the finish shows piercing tannins. Shows some weight and tannic build-up at this point; drink now and into '09.",87,11,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7009","Argentina","Round, melony and driven by aromas of pears and apples, this internationally styled wine should strike a chord among casual Chardonnay quaffers. It's kind of sweet, a little bit fat, and it finishes smooth. True to the blueprint in many ways; think California and this will complete the picture.

"7010","Australia","Supple and velvety, with a ripe, creamy texture, this shows textbook Cab flavors: cassis, tobacco and some vanilla from new oak. It deftly avoids the common Barossa problem of excessive size and weight, just could use a touch more persistence on the finish.

"7012","Australia","Full-bodied, soft and a bit woody, this wine's smoky, hickory-scented aromas end up slightly dominating the fruit flavors. After 20 months in French oak, the fruit has taken on a dried character, ending on a cedary note. Drink now.  Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.",87,35,"Western Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3
"7013","Spain","Consistent with past vintages, this crianza gets it right without setting off any balloons. It starts with raspberry and cassis aromas and backs that up with slightly citrusy red-fruit flavors. Any rawness or heat on the palate will be tamed by matching it with meat, chorizo, ham, cheese, etc.",86,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7018","Argentina","Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years.",86,17,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7019","Australia","This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors. There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats.",86,14,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"7021","Argentina","Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7022","Argentina","Starts out murky and sweaty, before showing cola, green herbs and leather. It's a rather jumpy, scattershot wine with plum and boysenberry flavors and a grapy, flush finish. The feeling here is that Terrazas wines were more consistent and elevated a few years ago.",85,16,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7023","Spain","Open, round and a bit rubbery, this bright-styled wine is jammy and easy to drink. It has black cherry and blueberry flavors riding on grabby tannins, and the finish is where you get some of the “roble,” meaning oak-based chocolate and vanilla notes.",85,16,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7024","Australia","The Y Series is Yalumba's entry-level under their own label (the company also produces the Oxford Landing range).

It's a well made, modestly tannic Cab at a reasonable price, perfect for midweek burgers.",85,11,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7025","Australia","Starts off with herbal, almost rhubarb-like aromas, but also some darker, berry-scented notes that ease into flavors of cassis and herbs. The texture is almost creamy, with the structure of the wine formed more by crisp acids than sturdy tannins.",85,19,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7026","Australia","This medium-bodied Cabernet is becoming a perennial Best Buy. Soft, dusty tannins frame ripe cassis and dried herb flavors.

"7027","Argentina","Generic black-fruit aromas are bolstered by chocolate and char, while the palate throws up extraripe cassis and blackberry flavors. The palate shows good acidity and ample body, and while the tannins come across hard on the finish, food will help it along.",85,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7028","Argentina","Patrick Campbell, the man behind Laurel Glen in Sonoma County, has a fondness for Argentina and South America. His Terra Buena brand has some hits and misses, and this Malbec falls right in the middle of that range. It's sweet, big (14.5% alcohol) and decadent, with candied fruit flavors and a soft, fudgy finish. Drink now.",85,9,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7029","Spain","Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",84,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7030","Australia","Seems a touch overripe, with fruit that leans toward the pruny side of plum, then adds dark chocolate flavors. It's broad on the attack, then   narrows considerably on the finish and is pulled together by crisp acids that accentuate the wine's dusty tannins.",84,17,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7031","Argentina","The nose exudes popcorn, butter and spice, while the palate is downright resiny. In between all the barrel (or is it stave?) influence, the wine shows moderately plump pear and apple flavors. But the oak is always dominant, with the mouthfeel as the wine's saving grace.",84,12,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2

"7033","Argentina","Sweet and a little foxy on the nose, with secondary aromas of air freshener. The flavors are a touch brambly and herbal, while the palate is flush and chewy but also a little tannic and choppy.

"7035","Argentina","Clean, fruity and a touch candied on the bouquet. The palate is narrow but saved by ripe black cherry flavors and spice notes.

"7037","Argentina","Butterscotch, roast corn and a general aromatic flatness don't really bring you in, but the flavors of pear and peach are adequate, and the palate has some acidic kick to it.

"7040","Argentina","Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel.

"7041","Spain","Cola, cherry and mint aromas give reason for optimisim, but the palate is extraordinarily hard and acidic.

You can see certain positives but balance and mouthfeel aren't among them.",82,40,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7043","Argentina","Port, anyone? This is a prune-filled, raisiny wine. Naturally, it lacks balance and mouthfeel, which is replaced by a grating, starchy feel. Overall it has a few redeeming qualities and an okay finish.",81,14,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1

"7046","Austria","The old vines on the steep slopes of the Heiligenstein vineyard give one of Austria's greatest wines.

The end is satisfying, with acidity adding a lift.",94,58,"Kamptal","Riesling",48.585085,15.4126618,3
"7048","France","Based mainly on vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this impressive wine is superbly rich with just the merest hint of age.

"7049","France","Named not after the goddess of love, but the horse that Agrapart uses to plough the vines, this superb wine comes from 50-year-old vines, the clay   element in the soil giving richness, the minerality giving balance, lifting up the yellow fruit flavors with excellent acidity.",93,120,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7050","Austria","The Heiligenstein vineyard is a great one, and from this Willi Bründlmayer produces three great wines.

"7052","France","The wine is currently closed up, not offering huge flavors. So it is a question of feeling the richness, the steely edge and the yellow fruits. It is certainly very dense, needing several years' aging, finishing with vanilla creaminess.",94,75,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2

Too snappy and short on personality; a step down from previous vintages.",83,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7080","Chile","An apple pie type of wine, meaning it's got baked apple, cinnamon and pastry aromas and flavors. The palate is kind of soft and sticky, and with little vital acidity it struggles to keep up. Standard warm-climate Chardonnay.",83,12,"Maule Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"7081","Chile","The variety's requisite citrus and green aromas are on display, but they aren't very defined or exciting. Neither is the wet, chunky palate, which may be moderately fresh but doesn't offer much besides basic pineapple, kiwi and green melon. 270,000 cases made.",83,8,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"7082","Chile","Slightly prickly and pickled on the nose, with snappy red fruit in the raspberry vein. Resiny on the aftertaste, with dry tannins and an elevated level of acidity. Basic and a bit raw.",83,12,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7083","Chile","Modest black cherry aromas mix with compost, tomato and other earthy smells, and the wine feels chunky and creamy, with candied, sweet flavors. A bit medicinal on the finish. Doesn't offend but doesn't click.",82,15,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"7084","Chile","Chardonnay without much Casablanca imprint. Melony and green tasting, with softness in the mouth and a pithy lime finish. Gold in color; loaded down and tropical.",82,13,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"7085","Chile","Yellow in color, with melon aromas that fall flat. Yet the feel is like electroshock in terms of acidity, with green apple and lime flavors running in all directions. Unfocused and super green and bouncy. Not well balanced.",82,12,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"7086","Chile","Grapefruit and green fruit aromas on the nose, then a peachy sweet palate of canned fruits and syrup. So much pineapple and mango that it hardly seems like Casablanca SB. On a short life line.",82,12,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"7087","Argentina","Aromas of pickled cabbage and cider are not too attractive, while the palate is surprisingly spritzy and tastes of sweet canned fruit, vanilla and oak dust. Resiny on the finish, with a hint of overripe melon, corn and butter.",82,12,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7088","Chile","Prickly plum aromas are dark, bulky and frankly strange and alarming. The palate is super pointed and fierce, with sweet, funky red fruit and candied red licorice flavors. Hard, aggressive and high in acidity.",81,21,"Leyda Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,3
"7089","Chile","Dense and dark, but buried with marshmallow and cloying sweet-oak flavors and aromas. Tastes rather funky and artificial, with vanilla, oak, cream and resin, but very little true fruit.",81,14,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7090","Chile","Acceptable aromas but all acid in the mouth. A sour, bitter, red fruit dominant wine with very little going for it. Offers nothing but sourness on the palate and finish.",80,13,"Lontué Valley","Merlot",-35.0567954,-71.2688602,3
"7091","Italy","A cult wine and an international superstar, Redigaffi (100% Merlot) will blow you away with its richness, opulence and smoothness. Aromatic layers of milk chocolate, nutmeg, vanilla and Christmas spice peel back one thick layer after the next. This is a loudspeaker wine with extraordinary intensity and softness from start to finish.",96,330,"Tuscany","Merlot",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7092","Chile","We haven't seen anything labeled Trio for years, but the return of this Concha y Toro brand seems solid. Aromas of orange blossom, lime and other green fruits are good, while flavors of citrus, grapefruit and cucumber are fresh and appealing. A good but standard wine that is lifted by a touch of green herb and brine.",86,14,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"7093","New Zealand","Seems a bit on the woody side for now, boasting aromas of dark roasted coffee backed by hints of plummy fruit. The cedary, coffee-tinged oak continues on the palate, where it imparts a slightly dry, tannic edge to this otherwise supple, rounded wine. Give it a year or two to see if the oak integrates with time.",86,23,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7094","Chile","True aromas of green fruit and grapefruit send it off in the right direction. For Maule SB, this is pretty lively and refreshing. The palate features zesty green-apple flavors backed by a jumpy, agile finish. Nothing special but good while it's young and fresh.",86,9,"Maule Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"7095","Italy","Tobacco, spice, black pepper corn, clove and cured meats create a powerful and inviting wine that would pair well with the heartiest of meat dishes. This excellent expression is very representative of Syrah from sun-drenched Tuscany and it offers a smooth texture and polished tannins with a blast of espresso on the close. Drink after 2012.",93,35,"Tuscany","Syrah",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7097","Chile","After several years spent in Chile's land of the lost, Santa Carolina is now refocusing its winemaking efforts with noticeable results. This SB shows mineral, melon and piquant zap. It's got grapefruit, passion fruit and citrus, and the finish is both crisp and generous. A good quaffer that's on the spot. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",86,10,"Rapel Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"7098","Italy","This beautifully extracted wine has aged for 18 months in oak to obtain the level of opulence and sophistication it boasts now. It feels smooth and velvety on the tongue and carries long-lasting flavors of blackberry, allspice, leather, white pepper and coffee.",92,54,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7099","Argentina","Three years ago Trapiche started making three high-end single-vineyard Malbecs; Aciar's seems a little more closed and flat than its cousins, but it does pump forward with rock-solid blackberry and cola flavors. It's better on the attack than the follow-through, but the flavors are excellent and the balance is proper even if the length is short.",90,47,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7100","Chile","Friendly, easygoing Cabernet in which almost everyone will be able to find something good.

Lightweight but round and well structured with a moderate finish.",86,10,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Pinot Noir",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"7102","Chile","A bit on the heavy and stewed side, but good in terms of fruit content. The feel is rich, rubbery and tannic, while the flavors run toward medicinal, syrupy berry fruit and then a warm, lightly baked sweetness on the finish. Ripe and rugged Chilean Cabernet.",86,17,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7103","Chile","Here's a simple, standard Chardonnay that is more neutral than anything, but at this level that's really what one should expect. The palate is a touch chunky and warm, with flavors of melon and citrus. And the finish is citric, with a little sugar and also a spot of pithy bitterness.",86,13,"Curicó Valley","Chardonnay",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,2
"7104","Argentina","Quite floral and thus it smells different than the usual beefy, black-fruit-dominated Malbecs that Mendoza is known for. On the palate, it's zesty and yields cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is crisp and stylish, while the finish settles and doesn't seem too acidic or lean.",86,16,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7105","Australia","Crisp black cherry and mint aromas burst from the glass, then carry over onto the chunky, authoritative palate before finishing slightly dusty and astringent.

"7106","Chile","As per usual, this wine offers solid berry fruit aromas as well as good balance and varietal correctness.

Finishes with a touch of chocolate and wood spice.",86,10,"Maule Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"7107","Argentina","Jammy black fruit aromas are pleasant, while the palate has a feel and flow that rolls along nicely. Tastes of baked black fruits and vanilla, while the finish is solid and keeps its form. Slightly herbal if you did deep, but good overall especially when you consider the price.",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7108","Chile","A common nose of apple, mild toast and baked corn is about what you'd expect from this brand and Chile. Like its cousin called Cefiro (from Viña Casablanca), it's geared toward apple, spice and vanilla. Not overoaked or forced; good but basic.",86,10,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2

"7111","New Zealand","Growing Syrah in Marlborough may be pushing the boundaries a little far, but in some vintages this wine can be exciting. In 2006, it boasts complex aromas of sweaty leather and grilled meat followed by savory notes of black olive, but lacks a little bit of freshness and vibrancy. Drink over the near term with roasts or steaks.",86,60,"Marlborough","Syrah",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7112","Italy","The wine opens with a brilliant ruby hue and ripe aromas of strawberry jam and cherry marmalade.

"7113","Chile","A bit sweet and candied on the nose, palate and finish, but good if you like creamy, sweet, vanilla notes in your Cabernet. The feel is sort of soft and soupy, while flavors of candied, gummy red berry and prune maintain enough vitality to bring things home. A lot like a cherry-cola ice cream float.",86,13,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7114","Argentina","Gritty, medicinal, almost reduced aromas of blueberry are devoid of softness, while the palate is also kind of tight and tough. Seems more clipped and underdone than the 2005, with narrow tannins and a medicinal burn. Has its merits and its intentions seem true, but something's not quite clicking here.",86,21,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"7117","Italy","Compact and delicate with an aromatic lacework of raspberry, almonds and forest berry, this is a feminine rosé blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo that would pair beautifully with light finger foods or salads. It has good freshness and a crisp close.",86,12,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7118","Italy","This is a simple and approachable Chianti Rufina that drinks well and would make a good companion to easy, stay-home pasta dinners.

"7121","Argentina","Regular but inviting, with good berry aromas and only a modicum of baked-fruit grit to the nose.

Easygoing, simple Malbec from San Juan province.",86,10,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"7122","France","Like many of Denis Pommier's wines, this comes from old vines, and the concentration is testament to that. The texture is rich, touched by honeyed wood, with peaches in syrup ripeness. As a contrast, there is also a fresh, red apple acidity, which gives a lift to the aftertaste.",86,34,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7123","New Zealand","Sourced from the slightly warmer Bendigo subregion, this is a round, rather full-bodied Pinot Noir with dark fruit flavors and accents of smoke and cedar. It seems a bit woody in style, but may improve with short-term (1–2 years) cellaring.",86,25,"Central Otago","Pinot Noir",-44.9566315,169.3988451,3
"7124","Austria","Light, fresh, perfumed with acacia blossom, this is a great warm weather aperitif wine, as well as one that goes well with any fish.

"7125","New Zealand","For what should be a special bottling, this vintage of Icon SB seems a little deficient. It's still a nice wine, but gives the restrained impression of underripe fig and green tomato without being overly herbal or expressive.",85,22,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7126","France","On the tart side, emphasizing grapefruit rather than riper citrus and with a definite texture of very green apple skins. Initially this is too crisp for its own good, but then with seafood, it works well. Screwcap.",85,22,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7127","Argentina","Plum and dry spice aromas are solid and don't steer you wrong, while the palate has reasonably good depth and feel along with sweet berry flavors that show no variety or evolution once they get going. A little sugary on the finish, but solid as a whole.",85,14,"Other","Pinot Noir",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"7128","France","A great selection for those seeking an affordable organically grown Merlot.

With solid structure and good balance, this is sure to be a crowd pleaser.",85,10,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4
"7129","France","Moderately intense on the nose with dominating earthy, forest floor notes backed by red plum guts and cherry along with a hint of vanilla ice cream with raspberry sauce swirled in.

"7131","Argentina","Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.",85,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7132","France","Tight green apple and citrus acidity dominates this wine. It is very crisp, at this stage too crisp, and the structure is on the lean side. It certainly reflects the cool growing conditions of 2007.",85,47,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7133","Chile","Comfortable enough, with common aromas of black fruit, spice, earth and leather. Given that production on this wine is now a whopping million cases, anything palatable should be considered a success. Casillero has reasonably good plum, cassis and brambly flavors, with a hint of oak in support. The mouthfeel is narrow, but overall the wine tastes real.",85,12,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"7134","France","Light and crisp, this is a fresh style of wine without much weight. There are a toast element from wood, some green berry structure, flavors of white currants, and tight acidity. The finish shows citrus and high toast. Screwcap.",85,35,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7135","Chile","Clumsy out of the starting blocks, with creamy chocolate aromas, leather and leafiness. The palate is solid and concentrated, but short on elegance and depth of flavor.

"7136","Chile","Opens in a soft, dusty, melony way, with cider-like flavors, melon and dryness as opposed to chiseled zest. Satisfying but on the bland side, with cider on the finish. Good for casual consumption but unexciting.",85,13,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3
"7137","Argentina","A clean and easy style of Chardonnay with peach and melon aromas followed by a melony palate with nectarine and a touch of sweetness. It flattens out and loses intensity on the finish, but overall it's totally drinkable and solid.",85,8,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7138","Argentina","Bold, aggressive aromas of shoe polish, grainy oak, campfire and heat lead to a grabby, wide palate with sweet flavors of candied fruit and marshmallow. There's a lot of superficiality here, particular oak, but there's also legitimate Malbec fruit and character that make it worthwhile.",85,16,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7139","Argentina","Candied cherry aromas are simple and sweet, while the young, jammy palate is clean, fresh and offers basic berry flavors. Finishes with some thickness, but overall this is the type of wine that we can recommend at $6.",85,6,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"7143","New Zealand","This is made in a plump, cheerful style, combining simple, jammy cherry fruit with ample vanilla.

"7146","Argentina","Good for Argentine Chard but not worth the price. It starts with mellow peach and apricot aromas, which are followed by melon, papaya and banana flavors.

"7148","Chile","Slightly brambled on the nose, but more than that there's a strong essence of candied fruit, marshmallow and overt sweetness to the bouquet. Once it settles, the wine offers creamy, candied red-fruit flavors and then a sweet, slightly tannic finish. Wide and voluminous, but not overly refined. 25,000 cases made.",85,13,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3

"7150","Argentina","Formely known as Winemaker's Selection, this base-level Malbec is ultra purple and dark, with gritty, grapey aromas that are big but not all that well formed.

Nothing special but nothing wrong, and therein lies its virtue.",84,6,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7152","Argentina","Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",84,11,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1
"7153","Argentina","Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.",84,16,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7154","Argentina","Very light in color and body, with citric and chewing gum aromas along with a spot of caramel. The palate is lean, jumpy and fresh, with tart cherry and plum skin flavors.

"7158","Chile","Aromas of pear, citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay, but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch.

"7160","Argentina","Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.",84,10,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7161","Chile","Dry, smoky and rubbery on the nose, with olive notes. The palate is a bit sharp, with plum, berry and herbal flavors. Finishes mildly leafy, with solid overall fruit and common Chilean herbal-green notes.",84,10,"Cachapoal Valley","Merlot",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,3

"7163","Australia","Black cherry and dried-herb aromas lead the way, followed on the palate by similar notes, plus a dash of chocolate. It's not a big, rich Cab, but it shows some discernible varietal character before fading rapidly on the finish.",84,13,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7164","France","Freshness is the hallmark of this attractively crisp, apple-flavored wine. The lightness of texture manages to retain some good green plum skin, apricot and lively acidity. The finish is pure, clean, slightly honeyed.",84,33,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7165","Chile","Lightly herbal and light in body, with earthy aromas that include leather, tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style, with elegance. Problem is, there isn't much substance to it and compared to Chile's better Cabs, it pales in flavor and generosity. Also, the finish is kind of scratchy and thin.",84,10,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7166","Argentina","Granular, semitart aromas are pasty and soupy, while the palate is warm and round but tastes like sugary, artificial berry and cherry fruit. Sweet and a little chocolaty on the finish. A candied, rudimentary wine that isn't all bad.",83,8,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"7168","Argentina","Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.",83,11,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7169","France","Smells a little warm with notes of stewed red berries and brandied cherries.

"7170","Chile","Sort of creamy and unconvincing on the nose, with carob and stemmy berry aromas. The palate runs toward red fruit, but it's also a bit green and herbal. Finishing notes of chocolate and green herbs are typical of Merlot, yet there isn't enough ripe fruit or excitement. Hence, it's a mid-level red wine with some green character. Contains 9% Cabernet and 5% Shiraz.",84,12,"Colchagua Valley","Merlot",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7171","Italy","Easygoing and not particularly intense, this fresh Chianti from the hills around Siena offers good integrity of cherry, blueberry and red currant flavors. The short finish is highlighted by a sprinkle of spice and cinnamon.",84,12,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7172","France","Fatter than any Loire Sauvignon Blanc, this has some rich fruit, flavors of currants, an oily texture and intriguing candy flavors. There is a structure of green apple skins, but the wine is essentially light, fresh and instantly pleasing.",84,10,"Burgundy","Sauvignon Blanc",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"7173","Argentina","Better than in previous years but still brambly and stemmy smelling. The palate is sheer and fairly hollow in the center, with simple buttery raspberry flavors. Shows bits of burnt wood, oil and heat on the finish.",83,9,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7174","Argentina","Rough and stemmy smelling, and sort of scratchy. The palate is acceptable but that's about it, with creamy, sweet, wayward berry flavors. Finishes medicinal and a bit weedy. Similar in quality to the ‘07 Urban Tempranillo.",83,11,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1

"7176","Argentina","An odd Cabernet with aromas of paprika, stewed meat and saucy fruit. At all points it's difficult to find the fruit in this wine; instead, it's dry, herbal and minty, with a lot of spice and tomato. Doesn't do much to push the cause for Argentine Cab.",82,20,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"7179","Argentina","Slightly citric on the nose, with bouncy, edgy fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. It's a lightweight with as much tea and citrus as there is beef, bulk and familiar Cabernet characteristics. More like a fruit drink than serious wine.",83,13,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7180","Argentina","Reserved on the nose, with a hint of rhubarb and bramble. But where this wine really fails to impress is on the palate. It's sharp and underdeveloped, with tart cherry aromas and piercing acidity. Some mocha and vanilla come on late to help things along, but by then the wine has defined itself as borderline sour and miserly. Unusually short on fruit for Luigi Bosca, a winery we've come to like. Imported by Multiple U.S. Importers.",83,21,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7181","Chile","Bold and saturated to the eye, with black fruit, olive and other slightly herbal aromas. But where this wine loses points is in the mouth. It's sharp and overtly acidic, which makes the cola and cherry flavors ring and seem tangy. Thus it finishes short and scouring.",83,12,"Rapel Valley","Merlot",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"7182","Chile","Rather empty on the nose, with weak, gaseous aromas. The palate is wet and watery, with tangy apple and lemon flavors. Dull and mostly hollow on the finish, with lasting tang. Run-of-the-mill Central Valley Chard.",82,10,"Central Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"7183","Argentina","Immediately this wine hits you with a strange set of clove-dominated aromas that suggest Russian or Hungarian oak. The palate is hard, lean, grabby and tannic, with forceful clove-heavy flavors that cloud what fruit may be on offer. Finishes minty and clove-like as well.",82,13,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7184","Argentina","Baked apple is about all you draw from the flat nose, and the chunky palate is ultrasweet and tastes of corn and candy more than fruit. Cloying on the finish.",81,20,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7185","Argentina","Soupy and smells of stewed tomatoes and basil leaf. Short on fruit to the point of being weak, but surprisingly thick and syrupy in terms of mouthfeel. Herbal tasting but cloying on the finish.",81,15,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7186","Chile","Smells a little strange, baked and like corn. And as it airs out, it shows a mealy, cider-like side. In the mouth, there's sweet pineapple flavors and then a thin finish. Pithy and not very good considering it hails from Casablanca, the heart of Chilean Chardonnay country.",82,12,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2

"7188","Chile","Toying with oak on a basic wine such as this can be a dangerous thing, and thus when something smells and tastes and finishes as roasted and burnt as this does, we don't much like it. Expect earthy, leathery fruit flavors along with huge amounts of char, tar, peanuts and baked leather. It has decent mouthfeel and structure, but the nose and flavor profile are compromised by way too much char.",81,12,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7189","Argentina","Tannish-brown in color, with oxidized aromas. This isn't holding form and has likely already passed its sell-by date. Tastes cidery, with a grim finish. Barely palatable; wait for the 2009.",80,16,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7190","Argentina","Smells like crushed vitamins, iron and minerals, but no fruit. Weak, funky and sour tasting, and then angular on the finish. There's even some sauerkraut in the mix. Not what we're looking for.",80,13,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7191","Argentina","Severely compromised by green, minty, weedy aromas and flavors. If it weren't for the color and reasonably solid mouthfeel, this would be sunk. As is, it's not a ripe, balanced wine.",80,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7192","Argentina","Less volatile than Layla's other red wines but still a stretch. Stewed cherry and plum flavors work the flat palate, while the finish is more soupy than it should be. Good compared to its siblings, but pretty weak in the grand scheme of things.",81,9,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7193","Chile","Bulky and showing zero elegance and almost no detectable Pinot character. It's simply a big, sticky, sweet wine with an unctuous body and fake oaky flavors of Nestle Quick and marshmallow. Not up to global standards for Pinot Noir.",80,13,"Casablanca Valley","Pinot Noir",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"7194","France","Cornas is Colombo's home turf, and the 2005 Terres Brulees shows his mastery, offering up beefy, cedary notes but also cracked pepper and cassis alongside iron-like mineral notes.

"7195","Spain","Pure, soft, balanced and classy, with raisin, earth and fine leather on the nose.

"7196","France","The very reliable but little-known house of Ehrhart turns in a true stunner with this Riesling from the Schlossberg vineyard. Subtle but gorgeously complex notes of honey and orange peel serve as the opening act. The off-dry palate displays intense notes of ginger and candied fruit. This wine is both powerful and pure.",92,35,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"7197","France","Like many 2005s from the northern Rhone, Colombo's Les Ruchets needs time.

"7198","Spain","For a big-production wine (33,000 cases) with just 12 months of barrel aging, this is impressive. Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013.",90,19,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7201","France","Despite being rather full-bodied, this isn't soft at all, instead offering up scents of lime and lemon and firm, assertive flavors of apple and citrus. Finishes crisp and long. This could work as a mouthwatering apéritif or perhaps with raw shellfish.",87,12,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"7202","New Zealand","Starts off a bit slow, with scents of underripe peach or melon that are a bit unyielding, and a hint of matchstick-like, Fumé character.

"7203","Spain","Dark cherry, raspberry, mineral and black pepper aromas start this value-driven Priorat on its way.

"7204","Spain","Almost red in color, with sweet, juicy aromas of red fruits that bring to mind Beaujolais Nouveau.

"7210","New Zealand","Made in a slightly leaner style than what has become the norm for Marlborough, this starts with scents of passion fruit and a hint of bell pepper, then adds riper melon notes.

"7221","Spain","Despite its age, you can still smell sawdust, dry oak and resin on the nose. The palate is acidic and drying, with tight plum, cola and raspberry flavors.

"7236","Argentina","One of the year's best red wine values has to be this fully ripe and totally structured Malbec made by Alberto Antonini (winemaker for Altos Las Hormigas) and Hector Durigutti. The color almost gives away its power; and if not, the aromas of marinated meat, plum and blackberry essence will. Saturated, thick and modern, but made right. Perfect with beef.",91,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7237","Australia","Only the third vintage of Tempranillo for Hamilton, it's rather crisp and firm, with fresh blackberry fruit framed by vanilla and tobacco. It's nicely complex, adding hints of dried spices, eucalyptus and pepper on the finish, but could use a touch more lushness to make it really sing. Multiple U.S. Importers.",87,24,"South Australia","Tempranillo",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7238","France","Faury has crafted a wonderfully quaffable Old World Syrah in '05, with scents of violets, cracked pepper and ripe blackberries, modest tannins and a crisp, clean finish. Drink now-2012. Imported by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant.",88,28,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7239","New Zealand","This is a full-bodied, supple rendition of Marlborough Pinot Noir, boasting smoky, slightly herbal-peppery scents and bold cherry and plum fruit. There's a suggestion of sassafras or cola as well, which gives this wine an almost Californian flavor. Long and velvety on the finish.",90,29,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7240","Argentina","A classic modern wine with plenty of vanilla, almond and baked apple on the rich, nutty bouquet. Flavors of peach, toasted nuts and bread are stylish and elegant, while a beam of acidity keeps it perfectly balanced. A great little find from Argentina.",90,16,"Other","Chardonnay",-38.416097,-63.616672,2
"7241","France","A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.",90,50,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7242","Argentina","A touch of coconut and cream accents the dark-fruited bouquet, while the palate is less overtly oaky and more emphatic with its plum and berry flavors. No doubt this is a chewy, ripe, fruit-forward style. It's not for aging nor contemplating; best to just drink it down with meats and pastas.",87,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7243","Argentina","Chardonnay in sunny, high-altitude Cafayate will always prove challenging, but this wine gets it right. There's a lot of spicy forward oak, and thus the palate is expectedly creamy and tinged with vanilla, cinnamon and white pepper notes along with pineapple and mango fruit. The feel and body are both correct and textured. It's sweet and oaky but well made.",87,15,"Other","Chardonnay",-38.416097,-63.616672,2
"7244","Italy","For crisp, easy-to-drink Italian whites from a cooler northern climate, you can count on the Terlano cooperative of wine growers to deliver good value. Notes of exotic fruit, yellow flower and toasted almond distinguish this creamy, chewy Chardonnay.",87,18,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"7245","New Zealand","Kumeu River's entry-level Chardonnay boasts plenty of tropical fruit and citrus flavors, all rolled into a fresh, crisp wine. It's a simple fruit cocktail, but with well-judged balance and zesty, food-friendly acids.",87,19,"Kumeu","Chardonnay",-36.7772623,174.5588019,2
"7246","France","A ripe, soft wine, one that's creamy on the palate. There is just a touch of caramel, but the main flavors are of crystallized lemons, pears and honey. This is delicious, fresh, and a great aperitif wine.",90,74,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7247","New Zealand","As always, this is a rather big wine, with plump, melony fruit. Honey and smoky-minerally notes mark the nose, while the palate adds spicy complexity. Powerful and long on the finish.",90,28,"Hawke's Bay","Chardonnay",-39.1089867,176.7416374,2
"7248","New Zealand","One of New Zealand's most consistently good wineries, Peg Bay has turned in an excellent 2005 Chardonnay. The bouquet is packed with smoke and toasted nuts, but the fruit easily emerges on the palate, opening into peach, honey and bright citrus flavors. Creamy in texture, with a long finish that folds in a lovely honey-nut character.",90,35,"Waipara Valley","Chardonnay",-43.076058,172.704133,2
"7249","Argentina","A draft of menthol and aromas of chocolate and mossy fruit work pretty nicely on the nose, while the palate is superripe, a bit candied and accented by spice and coffee. This is a strong starter, though it falls off a little on the finish.",86,11,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7250","Spain","Much like the 2004, this wine straddles traditional and modern lines. The nose offers light raisin, spearmint, brick dust and leafy red fruit aromas, while the palate may seem acidic and sour to some but reflective of old Rioja to others. Strong American oak accents of dill, coconut and vanilla are present on the palate and finish. Drink now through 2012.",88,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7251","Spain","The bouquet delivers touches of graphite and rubber in front of traditional dried cherry and raspberry. Nice in the mouth, with softly fading fruit riding a wave of persistent acids and tannins. Snappy, old-school and succulent. Drink now through 2010.",89,26,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7252","France","Toasty aromas are the first hints that this is now a mature wine. Its layers of acidity mingle with toast, walnuts and rich, mature fruit. Definitely a wine for those who prefer their bubblies with some age.",89,95,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7253","Italy","Poolside lunches, seafood salads and quick finger foods call out for a simple, un-oaked Chardonnay and this crisp white from northern Italy fits the bill perfectly. The wine is light as a feather with cool crispness on the close that reinforces distinct citrus flavors.",86,22,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"7254","Argentina","Pineapple and apple aromas are fairly attractive and fresh, as is the light, wet and zippy palate, which shows mostly citrus and apple flavors. The finish is mild and clean, and overall the wine delivers clarity and a dominant citrus profile.",86,13,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7255","Australia","Produced by the transfer method, with gas levels adjusted and a dosage the results in approximately 14g/L of sugar, this is a slightly mint and eucalypt-scented sparkler dominated by black cherries and coffee. Ends on a slightly dusty note. Multipe U.S. Importers.",86,15,"South Australia","Merlot",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7256","Argentina","The only thing holding this value-priced Cab back is that it seems slightly overripe, which results in a bouquet that's mildly cooked and grainy and a palate that's rooty and sweet. But if you like softer tannins and flavors of root beer, chocolate and spice, this has plenty of that.",86,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7257","Italy","You'll find all the pleasing aromas that you normally associate with a no-fuss Chardonnay such as apricot, honey and white stone in this wine. This is an easy, quaffable wine that lacks great depth but that would pair well with light, casual meals.",86,11,"Northeastern Italy","Chardonnay",41.87194,12.56738,2
"7258","Spain","Wines like this are good indicators that 2004 is indeed an exceptional vintage in RdD. For a Tempranillo that spent only five months in oak it's fairly settled. The nose is a touch syrupy but you can only love the concentrated berry aromas. The mouth is bulky but satisfying, with huge dark-fruit flavors and balancing tannins and acidity. Jumpy but very likable.",89,17,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7259","France","This is fresh and lively with great citrus flavors and a firm structure. On the dry side, it shows crispness, apple-skin flavors and a light, poised, elegant character. Will age over the mid term.",89,66,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7260","France","Floral and fresh, this is very much in the light Delamotte style. White fruits dominate the palate. Balanced and poised overall.",89,74,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7261","Italy","There are only a few pockets of vineyard land in Italy with the correct levels of fog or moisture for noble rot (botrytis) and the Marche is one of them. But 2003 was a sweltering hot year and as a result this Sauvignon-based dessert wine lacks its characteristic intensity. You do get apricot, peach and honey over the wine's lean consistency and there's a slightly sour taste on the finish.",86,30,"Central Italy","Sauvignon Blanc",41.87194,12.56738,3
"7262","Argentina","Peppery red fruit and a strong whiff of a wet dog make this a leap of faith. The palate holds that peppery element while also showing raspberry and cassis notes. Vanilla and wood spice are front and center on the finish, and while it gets better with time, it never quite reaches fifth gear.",86,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7263","Argentina","Starts with roasted coffee, berry liqueur and toast, while the palate is pretty dense and loaded with boysenberry and cherry. The feel is solid and juicy, with firm acids and tannins supporting a peppery finish. Saturated and staunch, but ordinary.",86,13,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7264","New Zealand","A lightweight, delicate Pinot Noir, with a light ruby hue and pretty cherry and herb flavors framed by oaky notes of brown sugar and vanilla. Good value.  Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",86,13,"South Island","Pinot Noir",-45.1526707,169.8926333,3
"7265","Spain","Brick colored, with an earthy, gritty nose that deals leather, rhubarb and burnt fruit. The flavor package is reserved and citrusy, what some might call dilute. But it's classic old-school Rioja. Finishes light, with tea and toast.",88,21,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7266","Argentina","Opens with a nice combination of mineral dust and orange marmalade, while the palate is smooth with the flavors of banana and lemon curd. Suave with a splash of  necessary acidity. As always, Luigi Bosca delivers a very good wine.",88,18,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7267","France","Notes of toast and smoky quartz show on the nose, then add pear and apple flavors on the palate. From a Faiveley monopole in Mercurey, this shows a fair amount of minerality on the finish and a plump palate presence. Drink now and over the next few years.",88,24,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7268","Argentina","Big and earthy, with secondary aromas of pepper, chocolate and smoke supporting bold black fruit. Cassis and black cherry are the leading flavors, while the zesty yet oak-heavy finish is right on. A very good Malbec from what was an average year.",88,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7269","Argentina","Value-level Chardonnay has never really been Argentina's strong suit, but this fuller-bodied version is pretty good. It starts with citrus, orange peel and some dusty scents, which are backed by melon, apple and citrus flavors. It finishes with some pithy bitterness but overall it's nice for Mendoza Chardonnay.",86,12,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7270","Argentina","A giant smack of coffee and earth rip at you from the glass, while the palate starts out medicinally sweet before folding in chocolate and leather. The feel settles at soft, but it's not flabby. And the finishing notes of mocha-covered strawberry are pleasant.",85,12,"Mendoza Province","Syrah",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7271","France","A soft, very open, lightweight wine, that has some richness along with its white fruits. It tastes sweet, from what appears to be a relatively high dosage.",85,140,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7272","France","A soft, ripe, creamy wine that works because of its fine balance between soft fruit flavors and a line of acidity. There is some intensity of flavor from the old-vine fruits. Enjoy over the next two or three years.",88,65,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7273","New Zealand","Like many Hawke's Bay producers, Te Awa is experimenting with Syrah; this bottling features bold blackberry fruit with just a hint of peppery spice. Big, round and lush in the mouth, it's easy to drink and easy to like. Better still is the Zone 2 Syrah (aged in no new oak) that has been bottled separately—limited quantities of that wine may be available this fall.",88,27,"Hawke's Bay","Syrah",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"7274","Argentina","Rich and borderline syrupy, but restrained enough to keep its focus. The mouth deals brawny red and black fruit encased in meaty tannins. And with some oak-based mocha and coffee on the finish, it is solid as a rock.",88,16,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"7276","Argentina","Rutini's value brand exhibits a lot of forced toast, popcorn and burnt notes, all of which tells us that they want us to smell and taste oak. Supporting the wood brigade is syrupy cola and ripe black cherry flavors as well as creamy chocolate finishing notes. Candied but pleasant.",85,11,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7277","Argentina","A big and mauling version of Malbec. The nose is minty and dark, while the palate runs syrupy and full, with heavy black-fruit flavors darkened even more by a persistent peppery streak. Much less restrained and elegant than the Kaiken Ultra.",85,14,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7278","New Zealand","Lightweight and fresh, this is a crisp, peppery Sauvignon Blanc with a core of grapefruit and a touch of sweatiness to its aromas. Probably best with potent shellfish preparations, like mussels steamed in white wine and herbs.",85,12,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7279","Spain","Dark fruit, tobacco and leathery spice make for a nice bouquet. Tight and forceful in the mouth, with ripe black fruit and firm tannins.

"7280","France","With vineyards in the Côte des Bar, in the south of Champagne, the Moutard-Diligent family can trace its origins in the region back to the 17th century. This is a soft wine, a blanc de blancs (although only the back label indicates this). It is very ripe and creamy, benefiting from the warm conditions of the 1999 harvest, and just showing a touch of acidity to finish.",87,50,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7281","Argentina","Lively from the beginning, where red-fruit aromas are toughened up by notes of leather, earth and spice. Fairly robust in the mouth, with plum, berry and pepper flavors. Substantive throughout, with firm tannins and enough oak to create mocha and vanilla on the finish. Imported by Banville & Jones Wine Merchants.",87,13,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7282","Spain","Medium-strength plum and cherry aromas mix with earth and leather on a bouquet that's not all that fruity but still shows fruit.

Stylish in a somewhat classic mode.",87,44,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7283","Argentina","Bubble gum on the nose makes you wonder about carbonic maceration, but that technique wasn't used to make this fruity, simple and generally nice little Cabernet. Don't expect complexity from it, or much varietal character; this is your basic red wine with adequate sweetness and some chocolate.",84,13,"Other","Cabernet Sauvignon",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"7284","Argentina","Turning toward brick in color, with leaner aromas that offer dry fruit and equally dry spice notes.

Made from organic grapes.",84,15,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7285","Spain","Nicely done, a touch soft, but strong as a whole. The nose shows some typical Arienzo earth and stewiness, while the balanced palate is meaty but fresh enough, with good berry fruit resting on a bed of firm tannins and proper acids. Not a complicated wine; it's classic Rioja.",87,23,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7287","Argentina","A spicy sort of red, with earth, leather and forest aromas. Cassis, cherry and chocolate make for a tasty palate, although there's a bit of outsized tannin, oak and heat. Sturdy, medium in terms of lushness, and broad.",87,14,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3
"7288","Argentina","Deep, a touch rugged, and lively, with berry aromas accented by strong whiffs of citrus peel, especially lemon rind.

Balanced overall; one of this winery's best offerings to date.",87,26,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7289","Argentina","Lightly candied at first, but airing unveils more pure plum and raspberry aromas. Cherry, raspberry and plum flavors are standard but good, while the mouthfeel is firm and smooth enough. Mainstream all the way but likable.",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7290","Spain","Cherry cough drop, leather and moss aromas open it up, followed by red raspberry and some natural bitterness. Finishes with some gritty tannin and a slightly cooked, raisiny aftertaste. More of a throwback in style.",86,16,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7291","New Zealand","A credible effort in what was not an easy vintage for Marlborough Pinot Noir, Forrest Estate's 2004 is a light, silky-textured wine with scents of mushroom and earth followed up by flavors of cherry and cola. Drink now.",86,20,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7292","New Zealand","Thornbury's 2005 Sauvignon is rather tropical in style, with ripe fruit flavors enlivened by healthy doses of herb and citrus notes. It's plump and medium-bodied, finishing with a touch of easy-to-drink softness.",86,17,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7293","Argentina","Nice and spicy, with exotic aromatics like citrus peel, coriander and browned butter. Of course, there's solid berry fruit in there as well. Seems a touch pastry-like in the mouth, where sugars and cream come in waves. Chunky in the long run, but fun and big.",86,13,"Other","Malbec",-38.416097,-63.616672,3

"7298","Argentina","Quite roasted and ripe up front, with a heavy burnt/toasted scent that covers up most of the fruit that might want to get out. Plump and candied on the palate, with a sweetness that seems simple and out of place. Creamy and warm on the finish, with thickness. Questionable in terms of its polish and finesse.

"7301","Australia","Though this is the reserve-tier Chard, it seems simpler than the other Jacob's Creek offering.

"7305","New Zealand","This consistent value performer is made specially for the U.S. importer by a winery whose “name” wine is imported by someone else. Too confusing? Try this: Winery A makes wine under the Winery A label and sells it for a premium price through Importer A. Then, since it has additional wine, it bottles more under Label B and sells that through Importer B. (No, I'm not going to spill the grapes and tell you the name of the winery in question.)

Short on the finish, with a touch of vanilla.",86,20,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7314","New Zealand","Broad on the palate, with a slightly corpulent mouthfeel, this wine features a pleasant bouquet of spice drop, honey and melon, followed by slightly more neutral flavors and a fast-fading finish.",86,17,"Marlborough","Chardonnay",-41.57269,173.4216613,2
"7315","Spain","Penascal has emerged as one of those value brands that delivers. This installment of Tempranillo is full of berry, prune and leather aromas, while the palate is creamy and rather full, with smooth berry notes and more than adequate richness.",86,7,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7316","New Zealand","A bit of a letdown for Seresin, but this was a difficult vintage, and we received the samples late in the cycle, when they could have been fresher. It's still a solid Sauvignon, with classic flavors of capsicum and passion fruit, just not at the level we've come to expect from this estate. Given a choice, go for the 2005.",85,20,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7317","Spain","Talk about a colorful, bold, jammy red! It's heavily extracted and, as the label notes, young as can be. The fruit is heavy, dark to the point of teeth-staining, and tannic. Not sophisticated or meant for fine dining, but full of fruit and life. Tastes good but is unequivocally rambunctious.",85,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7318","Spain","Hard leather and smoke aromas are the opening salvo, and there's plenty of warm earth and cedar below deck. The palate is herbal and peppery, with a touch of burnt grass and green pepper sparring with plum and berry. Finishes a bit hot but ultimately it's a solid, old-school Rioja.",85,29,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7319","Argentina","Heavy, with aromas of cornflakes and peach syrup. Unctuous and chunky as can be, with sweetness dialed up to the max. Finishes like a bull in a China shop, with canned pear, honey and raw sugar.",80,72,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7320","Argentina","Ripe, with leather, balsamic and prune aromas. Saturated in the mouth, but ultimately it's narrow in scope. On the finish, creamy oak rises up to leave butter and resin flavors. A fairly big wine with ample barrel influence.",85,20,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7321","Spain","A touch timid in how it doles out slight raspberry and light oak aromas. And that's in front of a mellow, quiet palate that offers basic berry flavors and not much more. Far from the most cushioned, lush wine going; it hits firmly and evenly, like a welterweight from a past era.",85,13,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7322","Argentina","A lot of up-front oak greets you, with sweet fruit and brown sugar in reserve. Cassis, plum and vanilla work the palate, which has some edge and tannin to it. Fairly well balanced, with some structure. No one will mistake it for sophisticated but what's here works.

"7323","New Zealand","Marked by its stay in barrel, this rare Pinot Noir from near Auckland displays smoky, bacon-scented aromas, followed up on the palate by savory flavors of dried mushrooms and cured meats. Not a wine for lovers of New World fruit, it appears to be aiming for more sous bois complexity.",85,30,"Kumeu","Pinot Noir",-36.7772623,174.5588019,3
"7324","Argentina","Light citrus, grapefruit and oak notes are nice openers. Peach, melon and other fruits grace the palate. Shows crispness in addition to oak, and the finish is lasting and round. Easy to get; pretty solid overall.",85,13,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7325","Spain","A sniff delivers aromas of dried fruits along with a smack of toast and char. Runs light to medium across the palate, with cranberry and raspberry rising as the primary flavors. Definitely a flyweight made in the traditional style. A new release that seems more mature than it is. Drink right away, preferably with food.",85,16,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7326","New Zealand","A solid representative of the Marlborough style, the 2005 Tohu Sauvignon fairly exudes passion fruit aromas and flavors, but also manages to sneak in hints of peaches (on the ripe side) and cooked peas (on the vegetal side). Medium in body, with some refreshing citrus on the finish.",85,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7327","Spain","Rusty in color, which is to be expected. The nose shows dried cherry, belt leather and cigar box, and at this point all seems dandy. The palate, however, is short and stewy, with too little fruit to stand up to the prickly acids and herbal notes. Already past its prime.",84,15,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7328","Argentina","A fat Chard made in the New World style, meaning it pushes a block of oak across the bouquet and then pours on the textured apple, nut and butterscotch flavors. Lacks complexity and vitality, but offers ample size and richness. Drink immediately.",84,13,"Other","Chardonnay",-38.416097,-63.616672,2
"7329","New Zealand","A step down from the superbly concentrated 2004, Matariki's Sauvignon features modest grapefruit flavors allied to racy acidity this vintage. Light and zippy on the palate, it's tart and refreshing.",84,18,"Hawke's Bay","Sauvignon Blanc",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"7330","Italy","If one man is to be named producer of Sicily's best Syrah, that honor must go to Francesco Spadafora. This monumental wine is a thick, inky-black bruiser that delivers a big rush of flavor: thick ripe cherry, tobacco, leather, smoked ham, cracked black pepper, charcoal, cedar wood and the list goes on. Intense, delightful and complex, the tannins are soft as silk and the flavors, multilayered. Imported by Banville & Jones Wine Merchants.",93,80,"Sicily & Sardinia","Syrah",37.5999938,14.0153557,3
"7331","Italy","Another blockbuster Sicilian Syrah from Spadafora that appears splendidly concentrated and inky with deep and penetrating toasted notes and aromas of prune, leather, pipe tobacco and granite.

"7332","Chile","A huge expression of Chilean Cab, which if you know the wine, is to be expected. Terrunyo pushes deep blackberry and violets on the nose, while the palate bursts with acidity that propels lasting dark flavors. On the spot, with a lot of heft and extraction. Imported by Banfi Vintners.",91,28,"Pirque","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.6793441,-70.5831069,3

"7334","Spain","Grapy and granular smelling, with heavy, raw aromas that lack finesse and agility but offer plenty of thump. Surprisingly, the palate on this dark, more modern-styled wine is kind of tart, with racy cherry and blackberry fruit. Not an easy wine to evaluate; you want more from it but it isn't that generous.",84,135,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7336","Argentina","Round, plump and creamy up front, with intensely sweet flavors of apple juice, pineapple, candied lemon peel and oranges. If you like easy tropical flavors it has its merits. Chardonnay connoisseurs, however, may find it too simple and sweet.",84,11,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7337","New Zealand","A new addition to the Icon line from Nobilo and one that still needs a little work.

"7338","Italy","Sandwiched between Cefalé's postcard perfect beaches and western Sicily's Madonie Mountains, this estate benefits from cool and hot temperature extremes and frequent winds.

"7339","New Zealand","This may not be as long-lived as its Matés's Vineyard stablemate, but is it ever luscious now.

"7341","Spain","Chunky but also lively, with pungent, aggressive Sauvignon aromas of prickly fruit, grapefruit and greens.

"7345","New Zealand","Aromatic whites seem to be one of the strengths of this winery, named for its proximity to an electronic eavesdropping facility.

"7346","New Zealand","A bit more understated than this wine has been in past vintages, but still of excellent quality, with lovely toasted-oat notes framing pear, melon and citrus flavors.

"7350","Argentina","Leafy red fruit, candied licorice and a touch of toast add up to the bare basics on the nose.

"7355","New Zealand","Only 56 cases imported, but worth searching for if you like Riesling. The aromas combine floral notes with stone and mineral, then the palate offers a vivacious counterweight in the form of ripe pineapple-y fruit and bold citrus flavors.

"7392","Australia","Has whole wheat aromas. The palate deals juicy fruit and nicely textured, youthful tannins. Medium-sized and built for the long haul; aging John Riddoch for 20 years is common down under.",90,45,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7393","Austria","Run by Michaela and Erich Hass, Weingut Allram has produced a full, ripe wine in which the fruit fronts layers of mineral and fresh, crisp acidity.

"7394","Chile","From Casa Julia, this is one of the better, more varietally correct Pinot Noirs Chile is making. The nose is dry, leathery and earthy, with a punch of cherry.

"7396","Italy","Attractive as a whole, and ready to drink at any point in the near future. This is Sicilian Chardonnay in its most mainstream, mass-market form.

"7401","Chile","Quite standard, but therein lies its virtues. Nothing wild or funky here, just fresh aromas of peach and melon along with good pear and apple flavors. Proper acidity keeps it moving forward, and while it finishes sweet, it holds the line on balance. Admirable for the price.

"7402","New Zealand","Ripe, not bracing, this new star in the Constellation portfolio boasts subtle aromas of stone fruit and citrus that become more apparent on the palate, emerging as nectarine and pink grapefruit.

"7403","Italy","This Cabernet starts with mild but inoffensive coconut aromas that are backed by pungent red fruit and a hint of herbaceousness.

"7404","France","Quite fruity, with tropical aromas of pineapple and citrus. Not much mineral or flint, but plenty of soft fruit like pink grapefruit, peach and melon.

"7405","France","With its simple, earthy fruit, this is an easy- drinking wine, which is certainly ready now. The citric flavors make it refreshing, but it does not have —nor should it have—complexity. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",85,20,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"7406","Chile","Great color but a bit green on the nose. Amid the timid bell pepper and green bean accents—and they're just that, accents—there's dark fruit and espresso.

"7408","Chile","From a difficult vintage, this is an admirable effort that just can't stand up to those surrounding it.

"7410","Chile","Smoky and round, with big black fruit delivering a serious opening salvo. Like most from Lapostolle, this is a big-boned red with full plum and black cherry aromas and flavors.

"7411","Italy","A golden, straw-colored wine that strikes the middle of the intensity meter but does deliver clean notes of exotic fruit, kiwi, talc  powder and dried hay. Three months of oak aging render a unique wine with pleasant notes of dried flowers.",87,13,"Sicily & Sardinia","Chardonnay",37.5999938,14.0153557,2

"7413","New Zealand","Stony and minerally on the nose, with some lime and pear notes that hover in the background. Despite its off-dry nature, it's similarly austere in flavor, offering up only modest fruit to go with its dry, minerally notes.

"7414","Chile","A whole lot of oak and nuts hit you on the nose, but underneath there's good apple and melon aromas. The palate remains highly oak-infused, with wood at every corner. Finally, however, the wood fades, revealing heady pear, melon and pineapple. A big wine with some awkwardness.

"7416","Chile","Purple as midnight, with mint, cola, herbs, crushed slate and huge black-fruit aromas.

"7417","Chile","Hard to believe that this Chilean icon is now in its 17th year. We recall back in the early '90s when it was just getting going at well under $20 a bottle. With this wine look for potent, almost buttery oak propping up ripe berry fruit. In the folds are notes of tobacco, earth, mineral and mushroom. Tannic on the tail, with some overt wood that needs to find its place. Hold of at least a year.",90,47,"Puente Alto","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.6186082,-70.5906057,3

"7421","Chile","Crisp and refreshing, with little to no oak character. By no means is it overpowering, but instead it features light citrus and flower aromas followed by apple, fresh scallion and spice. A touch tangy, but smooth enough. Zesty. Imported by Viña la Rosa USA.",85,15,"Cachapoal Valley","Chardonnay",-34.1718313,-70.6216794,2
"7422","France","A fresh style of late harvest Riesling, which favors currants, almonds and fruit salad flavors. It is poised and elegant, giving ripeness but not overt sweetness. There is fine acidity to finish.",84,18,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4

"7425","France","Ripe and sun-baked, with heavy aromas of honey, white flowers and pink grapefruit. Itï¿½s the antithesis of a lean, wispy wine in that it pushes substantial melon, citrus and peppery flavors. Finishes short and plump. Imported by Kobrand.",87,22,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"7426","Italy","Open knit, with raw cherry aromas. This wine has sweet and common flavors, with a fresh, fast mouthfeel. It's fairly chocolaty on the finish, with a hint of cherry cough drop.

"7427","Chile","On the heavier, stewed side, but still balanced enough to score points. The nose is earthy and dark, while the palate deals cooked plum and blackberry along with a touch of soy sauce.

"7428","Argentina","Big and burly at 14.5% alcohol, with blueberry, blackberry, fudge and earth on the nose. Very ripe and heady, with sweet fruit flavors and a ton of oak.

"7429","Austria","Fairly pungent and different; this is no walk in the flower garden. The nose is green and carries a strong whiff of grass and/or alfalfa. In the mouth, it offers solid melon, nectarine and mango. Better in the mouth than on the nose; it has a pleasantness and open-fruit quality that scores it some points.

"7431","Australia","This is still quite dark in color, right to the rim, and it overflows with complex aromas of flowers, herbs, tobacco, cassis and subtle oaking.

"7433","New Zealand","This is a big, round and fully ripe wine, weighing in at more than 14% alcohol, but aside from the wine's size and weight the alcohol is well concealed by the wealth of ripe melon fruit. Soft and easy on the finish. Imported by Meadowbank Estates.",87,27,"Hawke's Bay","Chardonnay",-39.1089867,176.7416374,2

"7435","Chile","A big-time effort for Arboleda. The wine hits with copious but balanced wood, which creates a strong blast of popcorn on the nose. The mouthfeel is sturdy and intense, with nectarine, honey and toast flavors.",90,15,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"7436","Austria","A lightly structured wine, but one that promises a firmer, steelier future. It is a crisp wine, pierced with green apple acidity and green plums. It is very fresh at this stage, but showing signs of rounding out.",90,27,"Kremstal","Riesling",47.9271368,14.080665,3
"7437","New Zealand","Championed by former winemaker James Healy, Te Koko is an attempt to take Marlborough Sauvignon in a very different stylistic direction. Barrel fermented with indigenous yeasts, it offers sweaty-musky scents intermingled with honey, melon and quince. Rich and oily, it coats the palate with slightly nutty flavors. This is unique stuff, well worth trying.",90,35,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7438","Chile","Yellow in color, and rather oaky. Spice and vanilla are the lead aromas and flavors, with peach, melon and toast in the background.

"7439","Chile","Here you'll find aromatics including rubber, cherry and leather; however, the flavors run high and dry, meaning there's piercing red fruit and not much love.

"7442","Argentina","A totally different breed of fox. The nose deals blueberry but also a thin, floral note that teeters on the edge of piercing. Almost crisp and prickly on the palate, with little of the heft and overt oak that so many premier Malbecs show. Racy stuff, but if you match it with food it might actually do better than some of the heavyweights.",87,34,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7443","France","Smoky and full on the nose, with shots of aromatized body oil, peach, honey and dried spice. Round and warm to taste, with flavors of peach, melon and fresh butter.

"7444","Italy","Red licorice, raspberry jam and a hint of cherry tomato make for a modest but open bouquet. To the contrary, the palate is hard, with fierce tannins.

"7445","Austria","Smells much like a bowl of freshly made fruit cocktail: there's apple, pear, citrus and kiwi.

"7458","Chile","A bit sharp and raw from the beginning, and the palate features a jolt of bracing acids that turn the raspberry and plum flavors sharp. Far more raw than pulpy, so it's Merlot on the thin side. Which makes sense given that it comes from the very cool, southern Bío Bío Valley.

"7460","Chile","A bit hot and burnt, with wiry, raw fruit. But for the money it's a sturdy, drinkable red wine. Shows sticky black fruit and a bulky finish. Fits the bill at its price point. Imported by Banfi Vintners.",83,7,"Central Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"7461","Chile","Grassy and fresh, with hints of cucumber, pickle and citrus. From start to finish the wine is pure S.B.

"7462","Chile","Ripe and ready, with a forward personality. Pungent and full on the nose, with in-your-face but scratchy cherry and raspberry fruit controlling the palate.

"7463","New Zealand","Fits the New Zealand stereotype to a T, boasting pungent, earthy aromas, then a burst of passion fruit and citrus on the palate.

"7466","New Zealand","This particular bottling from Goldwater continues to be an enigma. Despite the wine's fame (and price), I've never been moved by it. The 2002 shows pretty, Bordeaux-like nuances of earth and tobacco on the nose, then charming cherry and vanilla flavors on the palate.

Delivers a mouthful of flavor, but it's missing the silky mouthfeel of great Pinot. Imported by Via Pacifica Imports.",86,20,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7468","France","Gold in color, with round, honeyed aromas of peach and mango. Not steely at all; in fact, it's all about ripe fruit, softness and sun-drenched apricot and other stone-fruit flavors. Not a ton of depth behind the curtain, but weighty and warm throughout. Imported by Kobrand.",86,35,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"7469","France","Nice apple, vanilla and mineral on the nose, but flavorwise, the wine comes up reserved and simple. There's some citrus, pear and pineapple along with mineral and chalk, but it doesn't sing and it surely isn't intense. Lightweight; a nice quaff. Imported by Daniel Johnnes Wines.",86,22,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"7470","New Zealand","There's isn't much Pinot Noir being grown in Hawke's Bay, but this bottling is solid, offering up slightly briary scents of plum and black cherries that carry slightly feral notes. Medium-weight on the palate, with supple tannins. Imported by Klassen Wines.",86,16,"Hawke's Bay","Pinot Noir",-39.1089867,176.7416374,3
"7471","Chile","Good color and depth up front, with liqueur-like aromas. Rather intense, with full-throttle cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Generally speaking, this is perfectly good Cabernet.

"7474","Austria","There's just the right amount of structure with this wine to promise some good aging.

"7478","Chile","Starts out with strong aromas of open-cut wood, vanilla and mild red fruit. The palate offers acid-driven red cherry and plum flavors, with buttery oak in the background. More of a lean, racy Merlot with a lot of scour to it. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",83,11,"Lontué Valley","Merlot",-35.0567954,-71.2688602,3
"7479","Chile","Lime and slate on the nose, but then it opens and turns blowsy. Surprisingly tart to the taste, with citrus and green apple in front and banana in the rear. Finishes flat, with a soda-water quality. Imported by C & C Imports, LLC.",83,11,"Maule Valley","Chardonnay",-36,-72,2
"7480","Chile","Black as night, with snazzy scents of marzipan, Bing cherry and plum. Tight as nails in the mouth, and dead serious, with cherry, plum, mint and black olive flavors. Now it's rather tannic, with coffee and bitter chocolate flowing off the finish; will be better in another eight to 12 months.

Deutsch & Sons.",86,16,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7482","Italy","Gets going with hard, funky aromas resulting from either too much sulfur or heavily toasted barriques.

"7483","France","Rounder and fuller than in previous years. The color is a bit gold and the nose offers aromas of lemon and peach touched up by some toast.

"7485","New Zealand","Notes of peach and nectarine on one hand, and grassy herbs on the other, adorn a solid core of passion fruit and grapefruit.

Good value. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",86,13,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7487","New Zealand","Quite pungent on the nose, with aggressive Sauvignon character: green pepper, passion fruit, even a bit of cat pee. Fans of the style will find a lot to like for the price.

"7489","Italy","Smooth and nice on the nose, with cola, crushed slate and ample black fruit.

"7491","Italy","Always a solid value contender, Toscolo really nailed it in 2004. This wine is clean and ripe, with familiar raspberry and strawberry aromas. It's not heavy at all; in fact, it's light, bright and clear, with pure cherry and raspberry flavors that are sure to please. A pizza wine to the max.",88,11,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7495","Chile","Starts out sharp but settles after a while. Chewy and more sweet on the palate, but unconvincing as serious Cab goes. Bits of chocolate and crusty fruit work the thick, heavy finish. Fails to impress. Imported by Winebow.",82,13,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7496","Chile","Dilute and leafy, with slightly stewed red-fruit flavors. Finishes with some toast and smoke, but not much body. Seems more lifeless than it should be; almost Old World in style. Imported by Oriel Wines.",82,17,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7497","France","Much disagreement in our assessment of this wine. Our threesome of judges agreed on the green, almost salad-like aromas of the stripped-back nose. But on the palate we split. Two of the three panelists didnï¿½t object to the bracing acidity and sharp citrus flavors, with one calling it ï¿½backbone.ï¿½ Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",86,22,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"7498","Argentina","Sweet and extracted, with medicinal aromas of kirsch meeting chocolate bon-bons. Carob, malted milk and raspberry liqueur are the dominant flavors, while the finish is spirited, i.e. grabby and aggressive. Best if you like yours saturated and big-boned.",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7499","New Zealand","Simple, fruity and fresh—not the stuff legends are made of, but a fine everyday Chard that should please most everyone.

"7500","Chile","A clear attempt at a serious wine, given the heavy oak and ripeness. But maybe too toasty and touched up with popcorn and butter to meet the mark. Still, the mature apple character and inherent acidity keep it in the game. A winery to watch. Imported by Portet Wine Selections.",86,18,"Leyda Valley","Chardonnay",-33.6131574,-71.4501843,2
"7501","New Zealand","Less vegetable and more stone fruit suggests a slightly warmer climate, or a later harvest than a typical Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.

"7502","Argentina","If it seems dilute and distant up front, the palate packs more punch. There's melon, pear and citrus rolled into an amorphous mish-mash, while the finish delivers mostly ripe melon. Runs a touch watery at the core, but with freshening acidity.",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7503","New Zealand","Smoky on the nose, with some pineapple and citrus notes, but this is not an aroma-driven wine. It's more about the plump, custardy texture and gentle nut, white peach and pineapple flavors. Finishes on a tangy citrus note.",89,28,"Marlborough","Chardonnay",-41.57269,173.4216613,2
"7504","New Zealand","Yes, this value-priced Pinot is slightly herbal, but it's also got some pretty cherry fruit and a plump, appealing mouthfeel.

"7505","Chile","It's not a stretch to say that this is the model for blue-plate value Chilean Chardonnay. The soft nose offers pear and hazelnut, while the open palate is geared toward apples, pears and toast. A known entity, but good in its category. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",85,8,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"7506","Australia","On the palate, black plum and cranberry fruit is couched in a smooth, clay-chalk feel. It's not sweet, overly oaky, nor is it extraordinarily nuanced or ageable. What it is is a very good wine, appropriately sized for drinking with food over the near term.",88,25,"Victoria","Cabernet Sauvignon",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"7507","Australia","Smooth and inviting, with black plum fruit at its core. Aromas are deep and dark, yet aren't overt at this young stage. Feminine in style; not a wine for tannin or acid hounds, to be sure.",88,50,"Victoria","Cabernet Sauvignon",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"7508","Chile","Clean and nice, with a commendable blending of tropical fruit and light oak on the nose.

Finishes cushy but upright.",88,12,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"7509","Italy","Young and spunky, but very good when placed under the microscope. The nose is forward and fruity, with animal cracker and juniper as secondary aromas. The mouthfeel is full and ripe, and that's backed by tasty berry flavors. With tannin and chocolate on the finish you can safely say that's it's a full package in its price range. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",88,13,"Central Italy","Sangiovese",41.87194,12.56738,3
"7510","New Zealand","This Hawke's Bay winery has turned a credible example of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Medium-weight, likely fattened up by a hint of residual sugar, but the flavors are sure: celery leaf and bell pepper joined by grapefruit and red berries. Tart and tangy on the finish.

"7513","Chile","Opens with peach, nectarine and cinnamon notes. In the mouth, there are plump melon, apple and banana flavors. Finishes a bit flat and flabby, but still wet enough to remain likable. Short on stuffing but better around the edges. Imported by Vintus.",85,11,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"7514","Chile","Falls firmly into the herbaceous, grassy style that emphasizes pickle barrel, jalapeño and asparagus. But underneath you'll also find apple, melon and a smidge of alfalfa. Good feel throughout, and consistent. Imported by J & F Lurton.",85,9,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3

"7516","Italy","Charred; almost tastes as if you came across a field or briar patch on fire. In the mouth it holds on to that burnt character, and the tannins seem exceedingly hard. More age should soften it up, but in its relative youth it's a raw, tough wine with screeching tannins. Imported by Winebow.",85,55,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7517","Chile","Vinegar and horseradish mar the plum notes on the nose, while the palate is exceedingly lean and snappy. Raspberry flavors fade as fast they arrive, and overall it's devoid of richness.",81,9,"Curicó Valley","Merlot",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"7518","Chile","Good color, but mossy and rooty, with lemon-cola aromas. Shrill and tangy, with heat. Fails to turn the corner toward ripeness.",80,12,"Casablanca Valley","Syrah",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3

"7520","Chile","Deep in color, with sweet, rich aromas that revolve around molasses and bacon but fold in plum, blackberry and toast. For the price this is an excellent wine, and price notwithstanding it's very good. The black fruit is ripe, the feel just right. Just short of lush but full.",88,9,"Colchagua Valley","Merlot",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7521","Chile","Plenty of coffee and toast on the nose, which also pumps olive and some green bean. The palate is firm, with encoding tannins. Flavors of cassis and black cherry are convincing, but there's also some green to the package. Structured to age but probably won't improve much. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.",85,14,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7522","New Zealand","Fresh and fruity upfront, with tropical aromas and flavors that veer toward guava and banana. This is a medium-bodied wine with a fair amount of viscosity to its mouthfeel, but it seems a bit soft on the finish. Serve well-chilled to give it a little extra zip. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",85,15,"Hawke's Bay","Chardonnay",-39.1089867,176.7416374,2
"7523","Chile","Plump and ripe, that's for certain. Buttery peach aromas are what you'd call overt, while the warm, honeyed palate has punch now but seems on the big side, meaning it may not hold for long. A drink-now Chard in the easy Chilean style.",84,9,"Curicó Valley","Chardonnay",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,2
"7524","New Zealand","Doesn't show the vibrant, tropical features you might expect from an unwooded New Zealand Chardonnay, instead offering understated apple and lime fruit and a certain austerity in the finish.",84,14,"Hawke's Bay","Chardonnay",-39.1089867,176.7416374,2
"7525","New Zealand","A disappointment, given this wine's reputation in New Zealand. It's a light, sweet wine, with 95 g/L of residual sugar that's not quite balanced by corresponding acidity. There's a hint of vinyl on the nose, while pear, apple and honey notes are enlivened by a streak of lime but never truly sing.",84,31,"Marlborough","Riesling",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7526","Chile","Fresh, light and flowery, with a sweet, melon-driven palate. Finishes snappy yet a touch sugary. For the most part it serves its purpose, which is to prep the palate for better things to come. Imported by Banfi Vintners.",85,10,"Central Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-36,-72,3

"7529","Chile","Unconventional on the nose, with hints of leather, raisin and corn chips. Mostly smooth from palate to finish, with flavors of berries, cherry and chocolate. Holds form on the finish, which is solid, chewy and fruity.",85,19,"Aconcagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3
"7530","New Zealand","A wine that evoked no consensus among our tasters. Is more less or is it more? The nose is rich and packed full of asparagus, canned pea and pickled bell pepper, and the palate is thick and syrupy. One reviewer called it “good within the paradigm;” another found it mushy and lacking in balance. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",85,20,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7531","Italy","A bit rusty in tint, with lean, dry aromas of leather and leaves.

Imported by Premium Brands.",85,50,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7532","Chile","Heavy grapefruit and asparagus aromas create that grassy, herbaceous nose that some love and others dislike. In the mouth, there's additional apple and citrus but still a lot of pickle and grass. Zesty on the tongue, but too herbaceous for these taste buds.

"7534","New Zealand","With a core fashioned from older clonal material, this wine doesn't have quite the same vibrancy and fruit of some flashier counterparts. What it does have is some wonderful underbrushy complexity: earth, mushrooms, bracken and spice, balanced by just enough cola and cherry fruit. Finishes wiry and a bit herbal.",88,29,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7535","Chile","Unfolds with soft, almost candied strawberry aromas before gathering its legs to show more committed red-fruit flavors. An easygoing wine that snaps and pops on the palate. Hardly complex but satisfying in a no-thought way.",84,7,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"7536","Chile","Fairly firm and leathery, with an herbal/green streak running through the bouquet. Tangy as a whole, with cherry fruit and a smack of bell pepper. Tart on the back end, with drying tannins. Not dissimilar to a weak-vintage Cru Bourgeois Bordeaux.",84,12,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7537","Chile","Buttery from the onset, with coconut, olive and plum making up the bouquet. The fruit is jumpy and acidic, so it dances on the palate, supported by wood and tannin. Not a lot on the finish besides vanilla and butter. Seems more tart than it should be.",84,9,"Maule Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"7538","Chile","Purple in hue, with jumpy, unsettled, grapey aromas. Fairly hard and firm in the mouth, where cherry and plum flavors careen about on the jets of bulky tannins and tangy acids. Plenty of fruit, but not much polish on the stone. Multiple U.S. importers.",84,8,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7539","New Zealand","This, the largest winery in New Zealand, is capable of turning out some good-value offerings, evidenced by this light yet reasonably elegant Pinot Noir.

"7541","New Zealand","A bit disappointing from this producer, but still a good wine, the 2004 Huia Riesling seems a bit muted on the nose and lacking intensity on the palate.

"7545","New Zealand","Smells just right, with bits of passion fruit and grassy notes, and also riper hints of apricot.

"7546","Chile","Smoky and saturated, with jammy, smooth aromas of plum and cassis. Lots of tannin and depth, and thus it spreads out all over your palate in mouthfilling fashion. Features loads of plum and chocolate, with a likable chewiness.",87,9,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7547","Chile","Fairly herbal in its aromas: olive, pepper and tomato run the show. More olive character leads the savory palate, with dark fruit running second. Tight but not tannic, with a medium to full mouthfeel.",84,14,"Maule Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"7548","Chile","Here's a wine that advertises the Casablanca formula: pink grapefruit and orange on the nose, followed by lemon fruit with a fair amount of bitter zest. Being so citrusy, the finish is lasting albeit monotone. Fails to offer any richness.",84,12,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"7549","Chile","Dark berry, cassis and some funky olive rate highest on the nose. The palate is firm and ripe, with dark plum and raspberry flavors. Kind of pruny on the back end, with bitter chocolate and blunt tannins.",83,11,"Requinoa","Merlot",-34.2883749,-70.815833,3

"7551","Chile","Seems a bit overripe. The nose is soft, unctuous and overtly fruity, with a heavy melon-meets-citrus smell. Equally soft and melony on the palate, with a thick finish. Perfectly acceptable but not as precise as it should be. Imported by T.G.I.C. Importers.",84,8,"Maipo Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7552","Chile","Quite woody and minty to begin with. The palate, meanwhile, delivers a shock of berry syrup, something akin to blueberry or boysenberry. Warm and oaky on the finish, but also sweet and cloying. Likable but medicinal. Imported by American Wine Distributors.",84,12,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"7553","France","Ultra flinty and tight, with crisp, almost lean lemon and pineapple flavors. This is one tight ball of citrus, and it doesn't have a whole lot of texture to it. Probably best with shellfish. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",84,39,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4

"7555","Italy","Fairly full on the bouquet, with a dense roundness that cups charcoal and shoe polish aromas along with berry fruit.

"7558","Australia","They've toned down the new oak here, but it's still apparent on the nose, which gives up toasty, nutty scents in addition to ripe melon and pear aromas. Flavor-wise, there's plenty of citrus is this relatively lean, tightly focused Chard. It's clean and fresh on the finish, picking up some mineral notes.",87,16,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2
"7559","New Zealand","This is Pinot Noir that in some perverse marketing twist doesn't have the variety prominently displayed in big, bold letters to snare the Sideways fan. Scents of celery leaf and white pepper are echoed on the lightweight palate, where cherry flavors chime in. Peppery and fresh on the finish.",83,15,"New Zealand","Pinot Noir",-40.900557,174.885971,3

"7561","Chile","Full and melony, and ultimately rather soft. Bulky grapefruit with a touch of orange and/or tangerine are the primary flavors, while the stout finish is short and a bit too round. Not much life here.",82,8,"Curicó Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"7562","Argentina","This wine from Finca Sophenia is tiring and should be drunk immediately.

Warm, doughy and losing form.",83,10,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7563","Chile","Very little difference exists between this and the so-called “reserva.” This wine is oakier, with more powerful pickle and barrel notes. Otherwise it shows the same red-fruit flavors along with lively tannins and acids.",83,14,"Maule Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"7564","Chile","Strawberry preserves, leather, and some funk create an adequate nose, while the palate offers cherry, plum and black olive. Seems salty and/or pickled on the finish.",83,7,"Rapel Valley","Merlot",-33.9429359,-71.7361783,3
"7565","Italy","This wine hails from the Maremma region of Tuscany, and frankly, it did not really excite us.

Imported by Kobrand.",83,36,"Tuscany","Sauvignon Blanc",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7567","Italy","Strange on the nose, with hints of cat box, crushed vitamins, iodine and yeast. Quite rubbery and pithy on the palate, with papaya, green melon and some vegetal notes. And it's spritzy across the tongue. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.",83,20,"Northeastern Italy","Sauvignon Blanc",41.87194,12.56738,3
"7568","Argentina","Blunt and clumsy, with a slight vegetal streak to the chunky nose. The flavor profile is sweet and candied, while the finish hits with a wave of applesauce and peach flavors. Hangs rather heavily on the palate.",83,11,"Mendoza Province","Sauvignon Blanc",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7569","New Zealand","The Swiss folk at Herzog are making some interesting wines. Even this Pinot isn't without merit, although it's definitely weird.

Imported by Oenophilia Imports.",83,35,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7570","Australia","What a nice wine. Garnet-colored; perfumed with violet, meat, black pepper and cherry aromas.

"7571","Australia","The 2002 is a very interesting rendition of the 707. On the palate, juicy plums and berries are doused in Indian spices—curry and the whole lot. Roasted meat, pen ink and nut aromas complete an unusual, compelling, excellent package. Imported by Southcorp Wines.",90,80,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"7573","Chile","A challenged wine with harsh petrol aromas. The palate is limited in its delivery of citrus and little more. Quite lean and tart, with pop but what else?",81,8,"Lontué Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-35.0567954,-71.2688602,3
"7574","Chile","Tight as a drum, with less than ripe nectarine and green vegetables on the nose. Acidic, with tart citrus flavors and an extremely aggressive mouthfeel. Almost sour; Carmen's basic Sauvignon from Curico is easier to drink.",81,12,"Casablanca Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3

"7577","New Zealand","For fans of extreme pungency only. There's some grapefruit, but also large amounts of asparagus and hints of cat pee. Finishes tart, but not terribly fresh—after all, it is a 2002. Why is Russian River producer Davis Family Vineyards bringing this stuff in?",83,18,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7578","Argentina","Standard jammy fruit sets the stage for moderate black cherry and plum flavors. Seems hard on the palate, with jagged tannins that will drill away if left unwashed. Fairly flavorful, but lacking in charm.",83,15,"Mendoza Province","Merlot",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7579","New Zealand","Lime and lemon zest along with green pepper on the nose, and then sour fruit and too much canned pea flavor on the palate. Hard to describe other than to say that it lacks fruit. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",82,20,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7580","Argentina","Smells hot but neutral, with meek flavors of citrus and pineapple. Lots of vibrant acidity creates a scouring mouthfeel, but what is there to say about the bland flavors of soda crackers and citrus pith?",82,7,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7581","France","Gold in color with aromatic intensity. Trouble is, the wine is heavy and dull. Simply put, the watery melon and citrus flavors just don't cut it as far as high-end Loire whites go.

"7582","Chile","Pineapple, pear and applesauce aromas are more encouraging that what follows. The palate is simply too oaky and cloying. What you get in the end is a sticky product with overly powerful vanilla and caramel candy notes.",82,9,"Curicó Valley","Chardonnay",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,2

"7584","Chile","Heavy gold in color; a butterball of the first order. The nose is full of oak along with pear and apple. That's backed by a palate of sweet corn, mango, banana and apple. Toasty on the finish, with a splinter of pithy bitterness. Good Casablanca acidity ensures pop on the tongue.

"7585","Chile","Lighter-weight red-fruit aromas of raspberry and strawberry set the stage for plum and other snappy flavors.

"7586","Australia","I liked this wine very much, but not quite as much as Labyrinth's Valley Farm Pinot.

Imported by Australian Wine Connection.",89,45,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"7587","Australia","Hints of vanilla, or whipping cream, dress up clear, pretty aromas of pear, peach and apple. On the palate, it's not a fat wine, nor is it wiry—it's somewhere in the middle, with a dry feel and pear and mineral flavors.

"7588","Argentina","Saturated and extracted, with an incredibly deep purple tint paving the way for manly aromas of espresso, campfire and toasted coconut. The palate, meanwhile, runs a bit sweet, with boysenberry and plum. Soft on the back end, but with enough spine to see it through. For fans of bold reds.",88,10,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3

"7590","France","A fresh, but full-bodied wine, which has aromas of citrus and sawn wood. It is ripe, smooth, with vanilla layers sandwiched between green fruits and white currants. This makes an attractive food wine for fish and white meat dishes.",84,9,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7591","France","From the Boisset-owned Château la Croix Martelle, this Pinot Noir is something of a rarity for Languedoc. It is firm with dense wood tannins which cover the varietal character. The end is a fine, well-made wine which seems to have little varietal character.",84,24,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Pinot Noir",43.5912356,3.2583626,4

"7593","France","Different from many inexpensive Merlots in that it offers a fair amount of acid and tannin structure to go along with plummy, coffee-tinged fruit. Crisp and dry on the finish, giving it the edge to pair successfully with grilled steaks or burgers.",84,12,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4

"7603","Spain","Aromas of dark fruits are distinct and defined, while hints of perfume soften the bullish, rather earthy nose.

"7610","Spain","From the village of La Morera, this is a jumpy, spiky wine with lively acidity and a racy personality. Aromas of lemon peel, black olive and rock quarry precede a chiseled palate that's quite tannic. Pent-up power for sure, with a blast of toasty vanilla on the finish. Possibly a touch green at its core. Imported by Classical Wines.",88,46,"Catalonia","Cabernet Sauvignon",41.5911589,1.5208624,1

"7616","Australia","Light floral and honeysuckle aromas are very pretty and compelling, as is the wine's citrus-laden palate.

"7630","France","Here is a wine packed with light, fresh juicy red fruits. It has some dry tannins, flavors of herbs and a layer of acidity. This is a good wine for summer drinking.",82,7,"Languedoc-Roussillon","Merlot",43.5912356,3.2583626,4

"7632","Chile","Made from 30-year-old vines, this wine represents the pinnacle of Santa Rita's production. It's lush and rich, with vanilla, cedar, tobacco and cassis aromas. The palate is layered and textured, displaying the perfect mix of concentration and softness. Finishes supple, with smooth tannins and some chocolate and marshmallow. One of Chile's best.",93,65,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7633","Australia","Very acidic, with a sharply clean, almost green streak of citrus, although there are richer nuances of peaches and tropical fruits. This eminently drinkable wine doesn't have a lot of stuffing, but it's a great value, and very versatile with food.",86,7,"Australia Other","Chardonnay",-25.274398,133.775136,2
"7634","Australia","Has eucalyptus, earth and red plum aromas. This is a straightforward wine, but one that has surprising finesse, particularly given its reasonable price. It shows firm, ripe red plum fruit on the palate, and takes on a little coffee with air. Medium-bodied, it finishes with a gummy, pencil-eraser feel.",86,12,"New South Wales","Merlot",-31.2532183,146.921099,3
"7635","Chile","Light up front, with canned peach and pear aromas. Not that vibrant but clean, with sweet apricot and peach flavors. Good enough in the mouth, with a hint of banana and citrus on the finish. Not that oaky despite its “barrica” classification. Imported by Canandaigua Wine Co.",84,13,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"7636","Chile","Sort of an odd yellow in color, with chunky, hard-to-discern aromas. Pear and vanilla control the palate, followed by some banana on the heavy finish.

"7637","Argentina","Perfect color combined with one of the more atypical but interesting bouquets you'll find stirs intrigue. Aromas of mint, berry syrup and most of all clove are intense, while the black licorice and espresso accents on the palate work. Not Spanish in style nor is it reserved. This is a bruising wine with a unique Mendoza identity.",87,10,"Mendoza Province","Tempranillo",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,1

"7639","Australia","The palate announced loud and clear what this wine's color and aromas also suggest: There's just too much wood here. This is obviously a well-made wine, one with dry citrus and mineral components, and a surge of citrus on the medium-long finish. The toasty overlay, however, is overdone—without it, this wine would climb easily into the next decile.",87,40,"Western Australia","Chardonnay",-27.6728168,121.6283098,2

"7641","Argentina","This is what full-force, high-elevation Malbec is all about. The color is opaque, the nose a potent brew of herbal mint, blackberry and earth. With layers of warmth and depth on the finish, this wine represents the bigger is better school of thought.",92,75,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7642","Argentina","A defined, balanced, artistic rendition of Malbec. Cola and hard spices mix with leather and sweet marshmallow on the bouquet, then it dishes berry pie, coffee and mocha flavors. Plenty of charcoal and chocolate create a sturdy but delectable finish. An excellent Malbec.",91,42,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7643","Spain","Clean and big, with attractive baking spice and cola aromas. Bright, deep and full of cherry and blackberry flavors, and also fairly sizable and layered. This is the type of friendly, competent wine that should please everyone, from novices up to wine snobs.",88,10,"Catalonia","Tempranillo",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"7644","Chile","Lately, this rather unique Riesling seems to have found its calling. It's big and chewy, and very un-German. The bouquet deals melon, honey and floral notes, which are capped by dry, minerally stone-fruit flavors that spread onto the long finish. A pleasant surprise.",88,9,"Maipo Valley","Riesling",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7645","Spain","Grapy, bold and pure, with plenty of black fruit and healthy acids and tannins.

"7646","Spain","Who knew that crisp, varietally correct Sauvignon Blanc was being made on the plains of central Spain? The nose deals pine and bell pepper, while the palate is zippy and zesty, but filled with apple and banana flavors. A tangy, precise finish with tangerine notes is the final act.",88,7,"Northern Spain","Sauvignon Blanc",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7647","Australia","A straightforward Pinot, one with red cherry fruit wrapped in tree bark and tea notes. It's light to medium in body, and shows pretty earth and orange pekoe tea aromas. Will probably be at its best with food.",86,30,"Victoria","Pinot Noir",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3

"7649","Australia","From Mornington Peninsula, just south of Melbourne, comes a Pinot with pretty violet, earth and meringue aromas.

"7652","Argentina","Somewhat complex, as it begins with heavy bacon and tire rubber aromas that ultimately give way to more floral notes. Fairly thick on the palate, with sweet red fruits, glycerol and tannins. Finishes a touch flat and sugary, with some Port-like heat. A hard one to peg.",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7653","Spain","Sweet and stewy, with overt oak that comes across as toasted marshmallow topped with melted chocolate. Very ripe, with a rubbery mouthfeel. Finishes with strong coffee and burnt notes along with sweeter jam and fudge nuances.",86,43,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7654","Argentina","Ripe and a bit prickly on the nose, but it's way more sturdy than dirty. Flavors of apple, lemon and orange peel are fine, while the fresh finish is bittered up a bit by citrus pith",86,10,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7655","Australia","An excellent, feminine wine. Aromas (talc powder, flour, and caramel) are soft and pretty. In the mouth, it's round and mallowy, but just the right size; white stone fruit flavors have both floral and leesy nuances. Closes nicely.",91,65,"Australia Other","Chardonnay",-25.274398,133.775136,2
"7656","Argentina","Gorgeous aromas of pipe tobacco, mint and sweet oak create a full, meaty bouquet when combined with the blasting fruit that's on display. Flavors of blackberry and plum are ripe and refined, while the tannins grab but don't slam at your palate. Textured and chocolaty, with ample freshness. A winner.",90,30,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7657","Spain","Bacon, sawdust and earth along with cassis and raspberry kick start this lively, acid-driven red. The palate offers tart plum and raspberry, all steered to a point by piercing, laser-beam acidity. Oak plays a prominent role throughout, especially on the finish. The gritty tannins, firm feel and strong acids call for a few years of cellaring.",88,50,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7658","Chile","The bouquet offers a strong blast of toasty oak along with apple, lemon and mango. This is no weak wine; in fact, it hits maximum overdrive in terms of zesty fruit and raw power. A full-force experience, with subtlety not really coming into play.",88,25,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"7659","Spain","Chunky and mouthfilling, but it still has lovable characteristics of briary fruit, full-bore acids and a leathery feel. The nose is slightly grainy and animal at first, but it finds its stride. Plum and berry flavors are ripe enough, and the finish offers some chocolate.",88,43,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7660","Spain","The bouquet of this aging Rioja features a good mix of berry fruit, tree bark and earth. Across the palate flows a stream of strawberry, cherry and coffee. Firm tannins create a masculine mouthfeel, while the finish is dry with a tad of buttery oak. Gets better with airing and patient swirling.",88,19,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7661","Spain","The bouquet offers raspberry and strawberry fruit, which is followed by a meaty mouthful of plum, coffee and bitter chocolate. The finish is defined by mocha, and the feel is derived from firm tannins. This wine feels warm, arguably borderline hot. But that's probably more a result of youth than anything else.",88,9,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7662","Spain","Rather intense and a bit clumsy, but with solid leather, baked earth and charred aromas. The palate is roasted and heavy, with grabby tannins and awkward acids. Finishes with hints of tomato in addition to more acidity.",85,57,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7663","Spain","An oak-aged vino joven with a nose of cherry, rubber and raspberry. At first taste, it seems overtly buttery, as if the young oak were sitting atop the wine. As you get into it, that oak seems less obvious and more integrated. Still, it's a touch bland, yet competent.",85,17,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7664","Australia","This Merlot has some unusual characteristics, but it's still a compelling, value-priced offering. Both the aromas and flavors carry spice, bacon, straight-off-the-barbecue, rustic notes. There's mixed plums underneath it all, all of which is framed in a soft, easily accessible feel.",85,8,"Victoria","Merlot",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3

"7666","Chile","Rusty in color, with tomato and light red fruit on the nose. Shows mostly roasted fruit flavors and leafiness. Not a lot of depth, but not offensive. Imported by American Wine Distributors.",81,15,"Maipo Valley","Merlot",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7667","Argentina","Boasting plum, bitter chocolate and some earth, this is a fairly full Malbec, but not one that shows off the best this winery can do. For that, wait for the 2002 and '03 vintages, which are measurably better. Here, however, there's bulky fruit, coffee notes and some woody spice that are more than acceptable.",86,38,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7668","Spain","This Ribera workhorse from before the time RDD was a hot region hangs in there. The rooty nose springs with cola and spice along with dried fruits. Red raspberry and cherry tomato make for a recognizable, traditional palate. An easy food wine; mature now but with some life still in it.",86,19,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7669","Spain","Subtlety is not in the calling here. The nose is chunky, with leather and scattered fruit. Sweet plum and berry fruit is bolstered by forward acidity. Condensed and short, but undoubtedly lively.",85,25,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7670","Spain","Despite heavy oak, this wine is lean and jagged, with sharp cherry and plum flavors offset by some spice. Quite woody throughout, with a warm, solid finish. Hard tannins create a tight mouthfeel. Flavorful and real, but unforgiving.",85,15,"Central Spain","Tempranillo",40.463667,-3.74922,1
"7671","Australia","Classy, sexy and certainly ageworthy. Dusty, meaty, peppery aromas lead to a palate rife with dark fruit and substantial oak.

"7672","Argentina","Lauded Chilean winemaker Aurelio Montes traveled across the Andes to make this wine, just like the Kaiken bird does when it migrates. It's quite stunning, especially given the price. Look for black plum, licorice, cassis, earth and coffee aromas and flavors. The bitter chocolate finish is dynamite in terms of tannic structure and length.",90,13,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7673","Australia","Chalk dust, bubblegum powder and juicy, fleshy berry fruit is a lovely aromatic combination, and the mix expresses itself just as nicely on the palate. The feel is velvety, and the oak noticeable, but still works well in terms of the the big picture. Very nice, and shows the best of what Lindemans can do.",90,30,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7674","Chile","Clearly the producer is shooting for a rich, lavish style of Cab, and for the most part that's what you get. The bouquet is dense and full of bacon, mushroom and black fruit, while the palate is thick with plum, raisin and smoky, tangy, saucy notes. A firm, oaky, lengthy finish renders it consequential.",88,20,"Maule Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"7675","Chile","One of Chile's old-school, top-shelf Cabernets seems challenged in this vintage. The nose is herbal and mildly green, but underneath there's a sweet, meaty quality that serves it well. Black fruit and some creamy, chocolaty oak bring it around the bend; Bordeaux-like in its style.",88,60,"Aconcagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.653179,-70.0108675,3

"7677","Chile","The opening aromas entail peach, pear and some light oak—just what you'd hope for from a Chilean Chardonnay. Since only part of the wine was barrel aged, the body holds onto some snap and clarity. Still, some vanilla and lees character create richness and ultimately a good wine.",87,13,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"7678","Spain","Jammy and sweet up front, and almost like a fruit roll-up as far as aromatics go. The palate is chewy and sweet, with boysenberry and plum flavors. Pretty nice in terms of mouthfeel, and for the most part it's right there. This is ultimately a basic Tempranillo, just the right wine for everyday drinking.",87,12,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7679","Spain","Rusty in color, with hickory, leather and dried currants on the traditional Rioja nose. More dried fruit creates a spicy palate, one with cinnamon, pepper and clove. It's fading and still fairly oaky, with fruit secondary to the wood and acids. But isn't that old-school Rioja?",87,24,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7681","France","A 100% Chardonnay blanc de blancs that is presented without any dosage to soften the acidity. Yet it doesn't seem to matter, because this Champagne is deliciously ripe, packed with mature fruit flavors, a touch of almonds to go with the white currant tastes and a layer of toastiness. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",94,55,"Champagne","Chardonnay",48.9168895,4.1514325,4
"7682","Spain","Hard and tannic to start with, so it really needs time. Aromas of beef bullion, jerky and soy convey a certain smokiness, which is more geared to the nose than the palate. As for taste, it's laced with black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate. Very tight and firm, so hold for another three years.",91,138,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1
"7683","Argentina","Although this isn't overly stuffed, it manages to handle the spicy wood that was thrown at it during aging. With cinnamon and foresty accents, the fruit comes across light and distant. Still, the wine finishes clean and proper, so it should do well with basic foods.",85,8,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7684","Argentina","Sweet and mature, with earth, plum and raspberry aromas and flavors.

For everyday consumption.",85,12,"Mendoza Province","Cabernet Sauvignon",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7685","Australia","This is a solid wine—and one whose food-pairing possibilities could run into the dozens. In the mouth it's smooth, with subtle oak that's more nutty than it is toasty. Yellow fruit makes for a sturdy core, with peach and pear peel dryness on the finish.",89,33,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"7686","Australia","This is one pure, pretty, sturdy Cab. On the palate, black plum and berry fruit is front and center, with oak and caramel most evident on the finish and on the nose. Go ahead, show your guests some love and pour them something that won't overwhelm dinner.",89,30,"Western Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3
"7687","Argentina","Ruby in color, and light almost to the point of transparency. Flavors of cherry and toast define the palate, while the finish is a bit raw. Otherwise, it's a pleasing enough wine because of simple oak-driven raspberry flavors.",84,9,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7688","Chile","Great color, but what at first comes across as mint turns to and remains vegetal. Along the way there's snappy cherry fruit enlivened by bold acidity, and at the end there's some mocha flavor. But there's still too much green pepper.",84,12,"Colchagua Valley","Malbec",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7689","Argentina","Cafayete is not Mendoza, nor does this wine taste like a Mendoza wine. It's aromatic and racy, with sharp acids and a piercing mouthfeel.

"7690","New Zealand","Full-bodied, yet soft and enveloping, this silky-smooth wine seduces with its lush mouthfeel and ripe, plummy fruit, then layers on spice and savory complexities including hints of coffee, game, cola and earth. Just 42 cases imported. Imported by Kobrand.",93,60,"Martinborough Terrace","Pinot Noir",-41.2110025,175.4613314,3
"7691","Spain","Mildly burnt smelling, with whiffs of charred toast and forest fire. Plenty of black cherry, plum and brown sugar comprise the palate, which is also laden with licorice and spice. Numerous merits secure its place in the box seats, but could be too oaky for some folks.",90,145,"Northern Spain","Tempranillo",43.2691164,-4.2500792,1

"7693","Argentina","The bouquet is downright saucy, with molasses, brown sugar and leather aromas. Standard plum and berry make for an average palate, while modest coffee and spice carry the finish. Generally good, but fails to make an impression.",84,9,"Mendoza Province","Merlot",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7694","Argentina","A little oily and heavy, but the buttercup and candle wax aromas seem more real than artificial. The palate is plump, a bit sugary, but the apple and orange notes are clear. Finishes juicy enough and not overly cloying.",84,6,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7695","Argentina","From the Maipu subsection of Mendoza, this one runs on the heavy side, with plum and berry aromas, a chewy mouthfeel, and lots of sugar on the finish.

"7696","Italy","Heavily oaked, with cedar, mint and lemon-rind aromas. Becomes more integrated with airing, showing ripe red fruit and a dose of chocolate.

"7697","Italy","Surprising to see a '98 coming onto the market now, but the wine is fine, raring and ready to go. Cola, charcoal and sliced lemon carry the nose into a tangy, cherry-laden palate.

"7698","Australia","“Won't cost you an arm and a leg” is Fat Croc's motto. Made in the unoaked, ripe and juicy Australian style, this nicely combines deliciously juicy, tropical fruit flavors with plenty of bracing acid. It avoids the hot, flabby, fake oak flavors that plague most cheap Chardonnays, and gives you a wine that will work better with many foods than a lot of the pricey stuff.",88,8,"Australia Other","Chardonnay",-25.274398,133.775136,2
"7699","Argentina","Better flavors than aromas. The nose begins gassy and burnt, and it never quite sheds that harsh barrel smell. But in the mouth, it has sweet, chunky fruit and a pleasant softness. Our bet is that if given time to properly open, folks will like it because of its easiness.",84,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7700","Chile","Rarely does one get celery from the nose of a Montes wine, but in this case it's there. The mouth, meanwhile, is expectedly sweet, with blackberry and a touch of rubber. The wine improves with airing, but it's not a prime-timer.",83,10,"Colchagua Valley","Malbec",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7701","Argentina","Muscular, chunky and a bit sun-baked. The nose is smothered by sweaty leather and barnyard, while a bit of everything is accounted for on the palate: red berries, jamminess, even red cabbage. In the final analysis, it's got force but it's not focused or harnessed.",83,12,"Mendoza Province","Malbec",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,3
"7702","France","Great toasty aromas sweep out of the glass with this delicious wine.

"7703","New Zealand","Adds a meaty, bacony edge to broad, mouthfilling flavors of black cherries and herbs.

Round but short on the finish.",84,15,"Mendoza Province","Chardonnay",-32.8896247,-68.8526867,2
"7705","Argentina","Somewhat heavy and overripe, with plum and earth aromas. The palate carries a heavy, weighty feel, with rather murky flavors.

"7706","Argentina","Generally gimmicky names draw no applause from these parts, but here we like this wine's raspberry, graham cracker and orange-peel nose along with its crystallized raspberry and strawberry flavors.

"7707","France","The berry fruit is rather mute and marked by sour herb and woody accents. There's also a slight meatiness but the overall impression is thin.

"7711","France","Knockout Sauvignon Blanc aromas of gooseberry and pink grapefruit are followed on the palate by similar flavors, all graced with great intensity and precision.

"7782","Australia","This refreshing Sauvignon is clean, refreshing, though a little lean. Has soft aromas of trading-card bubblegum powder, and a streak of lemondrop that heads full-tilt into the finish.",87,15,"South Australia","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7783","Italy","Traditional Chianti, with no small oak aging and no Cabernet or Merlot. Leathery, with dried cherry aromas and a hint of tobacco on the nose, then shows bright, focused fruit flavors on the palate. Finishes with bass notes of dark chocolate and earth.",87,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7784","Italy","Dark and fruity on the nose, with a touch of gritty leather. Brighter on the palate, where cherry and raspberry hold court and oak plays in the background. Juicy, fresh, immensely solid and just short of excellent. A very good Tuscan red with a little bit of everything. Drink now through 2008.",89,37,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7785","New Zealand","This light- to medium-bodied Savvy boasts flinty, minerally aromas and an array of flavors that includes mixed citrus and tea leaves. Dusty, minerally notes add interest, particularly on the crisp, zesty finish.",89,22,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7786","Italy","Leather, earth and dried red fruits comprise a classic nose, while the meaty palate is both heavy and loaded with plum and raspberry. Quite chewy, with firm tannins, extract and chocolaty accents. Mainstream qualities give it mass appeal.",89,35,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7788","Spain","All the wines in the Abadal line seem commited to serious aromas and flavors supported by honest structure. This Merlot from an obscure Catalonian wine region offers blackberry, cigar box and raisin aromas in front of additional blackberry flavor. There's also chocolate folded into the finishing layers. Integrated and properlly welded by firm tannins.",89,16,"Catalonia","Merlot",41.5911589,1.5208624,1
"7789","New Zealand","Very cleanly made and modern in style, with pure cherry flavors accented by vanilla and dried spices from new oak.

"7793","France","Named in homage to its founder, Gambert de Loche, this is one of the top wines from the Tain cooperative. It is young in color, with fresh fruit and solid tannins. The flavors of cranberries and blackcurrants just emphasize the dryness of the wine. A serious wine that will develop well over 5-10 years.",90,50,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7794","France","This is old-style winemaking, but in the best sense. It is big, dominated at this stage by tannins. The fruit is dark, brooding and intense. It has layers of wood (of which 20 percent was new), while the acidity still needs to soften out. This will age, maybe 10-12 years.",90,88,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7795","France","A serious style, big with tannins and dry fruit, this is still packed with perfumed Syrah flavors. It has a dark, brooding structure, with acidity, and pure fruits. This is the pair to the more exuberant L'Amarybelle.",90,58,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7796","France","Great ripe fruit is just beginning to show through this huge, dense wine. It's big, and dark and, obviously still very young. But it is going to develop into a fine, solid dark wine which will age over many years. Buy now, start to enjoy in 5 years.",90,52,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7797","Italy","Real varietal character shows in this wine's full, dry plum and berry fruit. There are some slight green notes, but they're more tobacco-like than bell-peppery. With its moderate tannins and acidity, medium weight and earthy elements, this could be mistaken for a Right Bank Bordeaux.",87,20,"Veneto","Merlot",45.4414662,12.3152595,3
"7798","Australia","Lighter and more red-fruited than most Australian Cabs, Port-like qualities show in this wine's tawny hues and cherry, burnt sugar and earth bouquet. A mouth of slightly overripe berry fruit and the creamy, smooth texture are appealing, as is the attractively sweet, slightly hot finish. It's unusual, but that's not a bad thing.",86,10,"Australia Other","Cabernet Sauvignon",-25.274398,133.775136,3

The mouthfeel is round and the wine dry on the palate, turning very dry on the almost mineral-spirit finish.",86,16,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7800","Australia","Lots of cedary wood is wrapped around the red berry and dark cherry fruit in this smooth, medium-weight offering. It shows moderate acidity and a licorice and toast finish with some tangy tannins. It's quite woody, but likeable nonetheless.",86,20,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7801","Italy","There's oak galore in this medium-weight apple-fruited Piedmont wine. The palate is slightly tart, with tangy oak splayed over a Granny Smith green-apple base. Finishes with decent length, but again propelled more by wood than fruit. Oak lovers will gush over this, and will find more to like about it than this reviewer did.",86,34,"Piedmont","Chardonnay",45.0522366,7.5153885,2
"7802","Australia","This Eden Valley white has a core of peach or pear skin, with a dusty overlay. It's a pretty, though not superconcentrated, wine with dusty, white peach aromas. Finishes with more intensity and concentration than you get on the palate.",86,18,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7803","Italy","Dense, with bacon aromas as well as murkiness. Not terribly defined, but it does pick up confidence with time. Plum, berry and cherry flavors precede a round finish that starts off fruity then turns warm. Tastes better than it smells.",86,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7804","France","This is the label under which Château La Rame —a sweet wine producer in Saint Croix du Mont—commercializes its dry white, made from Sauvignon Blanc. No, it is not a profound wine, but it should be an example to other producers of humble Bordeaux blanc of what can be achieved through care and dedication. It's concentrated and intense, with a rich mouthfeel and bold grapefruit flavors that linger a long time on the finish.",86,10,"Bordeaux","Sauvignon Blanc",44.837789,-0.57918,4
"7805","Australia","Aromas are light—citrus pith and peach skin. In the mouth, it's a fresh, springtime wine; clean but not too lean, and soft around the edges. Flavors run the gamut of citrus fruits. Finishes round and clean.",86,8,"Australia Other","Sauvignon Blanc",-25.274398,133.775136,3
"7806","Italy","Named for the little hill's almond trees, this modestly priced super Tuscan is a blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% barrique-aged Cabernet Sauvignon. The Sangiovese provides black cherry and tobacco flavors, while the Cab contributes toasty, buttery oak and herbal notes. Drink now and over the next several years.",86,20,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7807","Italy","Depth and richness are hinted at by berry aromas with a touch of liqueur. The palate runs snappy and snazzy, with racy but tasty cherry and raspberry fruit. This is a solid, medium-oak Sangiovese that shows modern touches as well as traditional purity.",89,60,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7808","Italy","A varietal Merlot that is dark, masculine and pure, even if it stumbles toward raisiny and syrupy. What keeps it in motion is the brightness of the palate, where cherry, plum and chocolate dance in harmony. Probably best to drink soon, which will maximize vibrancy.",89,50,"Tuscany","Merlot",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7809","New Zealand","An excellent value in Pinot Noir, this wine is made by Matt Thomson, also chief winemaker for Saint Clair. It's dark and beefy in color, with brooding black cherry fruit on the nose that freshens a bit on the palate, adding beet notes and subtle shadings of herb and spice. Nicely balanced, with a long, silky finish.",89,19,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7810","Italy","A healthy wine with cherry, plum, earth and chocolate on the nose. The fruit is racy, bordering on searing. But on that wave of acidity you'll encounter prime and pure cherry and raspberry flavors. Arguably a bit skinny and one-dimensional, but still it's worthy of praise.",89,78,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7811","Italy","Some tobacco, vanilla and toasty oak mingle with rich black fruit on the bouquet. The palate offers plum and berry fruit along with some black pepper. A fruity 100% Cabernet with a chocolate- and coffee-tinged finish.",89,28,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7812","Italy","A big cherry-vanilla style of Brunello, with bold aromas and flavors held in check by a slightly acrid, weedy note. Warming on the finish, with a dose of spice and supple tannins.",89,58,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7814","Italy","Dense to the nose, with spice, mineral, plum and chocolate poking through a veil of lightly applied oak. Roasted stone fruits carry the palate prior to a smooth, chocolaty finish. With full tannins and good acidity, this wine is pure and balanced.",89,29,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7815","New Zealand","Bursting with ripe tropical flavors, lush and fruity. There's just a hint of green herb—enough so that you know it's Sauvignon Blanc—but the emphasis here is on forward fruit.

"7816","New Zealand","For Peg Bay's high-end bottling, this is a bit of a disappointment. It offers dried spices and cherries on the nose, then adds sour cherry flavors on the palate. With time, darker cherry flavors emerge, showing a slight element of sur-maturité. It's medium-bodied, with some firm tannins still in evidence. Hold through 2008 and hope for improvement.

"7817","New Zealand","Brancott's top-of-line Pinot boasts a sappy, creamy texture, combining herbal notes with bright cherry fruit, then adding cola and plum bass notes.

"7818","Australia","This is a very enjoyable Sauvignon, with a zesty profile that is green, but not in the typically limey, Kiwi-inspired way. Here you'll find pleasant aromas of fresh, leafy greens (lettuce, and even some mint) and flavors that reminded me of key lime or lemon meringue pie—citrusy, yes, but certainly not sour. A chalky, dusty feel completes the picture. 2,000 cases produced. Imported by Clos Du Val Wine.",88,16,"Victoria","Sauvignon Blanc",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"7819","New Zealand","There's a bit of wood shavings and toast on the nose, but also plenty of ripe black cherries to balance out the new oak.

"7821","France","This wine appears to be in a somewhat dormant phase, only stubbornly revealing hints of violets and bacon on the nose.

"7822","France","Guigal's blended Saint-Joseph delivers loads of Syrah flavor—from hints of bacon and black olive to coffee, earth and blackberries.

"7824","France","Hugely perfumed pure Syrah and flavors of blackcurrants and smoky wood - this is a power-packed wine, which shows a great purity of fruit. It has solid, dark tannins as well, which suggest it should age well over 5-10 years.",89,32,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7825","Italy","Starts off with rustic, horsey aromas of sweaty tack, which fade somewhat with airing. Sour cherries vie with dark, earthy flavors in the mouth and the wine finishes with almost lemony acidity coupled with dark coffee flavors. A complex, individualistic effort that takes some contemplation to appreciate.",86,23,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7826","Australia","Rosemount's new offering opens with a pleasant vanilla, oak and dark berry fruit nose. On the palate, the fruit takes a backseat to dominant wood. Oak and cedar flavors reign here. It's a little high in acid and tannins to be an easy drinker, and it finishes long and dry with a tart edge. Try with grilled sausages.",85,19,"New South Wales","Cabernet Sauvignon",-31.2532183,146.921099,3
"7827","Italy","Aromas of strawberries and milk chocolate gradually turn a bit grassy with air until a green-hay note takes hold. Light and tart, the bouncy red berries and cream flavors persist through the finish. Nice pasta red.",85,10,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7828","Australia","Like the label says, no oak has touched this wine. All you get is pure fruit, and dry, high acid fruit, at that. The flavors veer toward citrus with a hint of peach, and the acidity is very high. Elegant, crisp, and refreshing, it finishes with a slight burn.",85,18,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2
"7829","Italy","Clean and correct, with leather and sour cherry aromas and flavors that just seem to lack added dimension. Finishes hard and slightly bitter, with peppery spice and drying tannins.",84,37,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7831","France","Morey is better known for white wines, but this villages-level red is no slouch. It's silky and medium-bodied, with baking spices layered over plum and cherry fruit. Turns a bit cedary on the finish, where tea-like tannins grab hold.",88,33,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"7832","Italy","A little bit flat on the bouquet, with prune, graham cracker and tobacco aromas. Flavors of plum and black cherry are fine, but there's more acid and tannin than flesh. Solid but not spectacular; there's a bit too much displaced tannin to rate at the next level up.",88,29,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7833","Italy","Nice and smoky, with a solid, healthy nose that covers the bases. Good and snappy on the tongue, where zest and sweetness convene and deliver cherry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. Medium in terms of intensity and depth. Best now–2008.",88,36,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7834","France","A rich, lush melange of fruit and nuts, with sinuous, almost unctuous flavors that twine around the palate like a snake. Long, fascinating finish, elegantly balanced and precise.",92,55,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7835","Italy","Open in the nose, with aromatic notes of blackberry. Although it's rather simple and straightforward, it's a good wine. The cherry and ripe plum fruit come up to the brim, while the big, tasty finish is perfectly balanced and accessible.",89,16,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7836","Italy","Snappy and full of cherry, but also a tad green. There's cherry, raspberry and plum across the palate, and ample sweetness to the finish. It's not heavy, but the tannins are full.",88,12,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7837","Italy","Smooth and stylish enough, with hints of bold black fruit, earth and dill. The flavor profile runs a touch candied, with ripe but sweet berry and plum. A cool, chocolaty finish closes it out. Juicy, flavorful and properly oaked, but a bit short on structure and foundation.",88,41,"Tuscany","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7838","Italy","Muscular and power-packed, with a deep-purple tint, saturated berry aromas and a strong whack of oak. The mouth is deep, dense and chock full of blackberry, chocolate, coffee and cinnamon. No complaints about the richness and fruit quotient, but it's arguably too oaky. Should improve with time.",88,65,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7839","Italy","Not showing a lot of fruit, but smooth on the palate, with rich aromas of leather, old wood and a touch of chlorine or ink. Turns tart, dry and tannic on the finish; try in 2008 or beyond.",88,62,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7840","Chile","A big, flavor-packed Cabernet with a hard-hitting nose of black fruit and sweet oak. Monster blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors are accented by chocolate and pepper, and only on the finish do the hard tannins get aggressive. Excellent flavor; a bit hard in terms of mouthfeel.",89,18,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7841","Chile","Smoky and a bit nutty, one can sense that winemaker Rafael Tirado is aiming at a Burgundian style. Grilled peaches and fresh limes blend with pineapple flavors. Despite its crisp acids, it shows nice richness in the mouth, with substantially more density and concentration than the regular Chardonnay.",88,35,"Casablanca Valley","Chardonnay",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,2
"7842","Australia","This full-bodied Cab has loads of grape and blackberry in the mouth, with just a shade of vanilla bean flavor.

"7844","Australia","Don't let the youngsters get a hold of this pale-gold Chardonnay: The medium-bodied wine has easy-to-drink, apple-cidery flavors, with such low acidity that you might mistake it for a nonalcoholic cider. The sunny bouquet has lemongrass, apple and date highlights.",84,16,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"7845","Australia","This wine proves that too much of too many things isn't always a good thing. There are lots of superripe blackberry, fig and plum aromas on the nose, but these ripe flavors are masked by loads of tannins and acid on the palate. Finishes so hot that it's almost medicinal. A steak dinner may tame this bad boy.",83,30,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7846","Italy","Seems old before its time, sporting aromas of baked fruit and worn glove leather. It's supple and aromatic but lacks the vibrancy and energy you'd expect from a young Sangiovese. Fading, but still holds some appeal.",83,9,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7847","Italy","Light-to medium bodied, this Chardonnay is characterized by a strong floral-herb note that shows early. This almost flowershop-like quality shows more on the palate than do fruit flavors, and persists through the dry finish.",83,19,"Piedmont","Chardonnay",45.0522366,7.5153885,2
"7848","Italy","Reticent for a 2001. The nose is leathery, with more smoked meat and tomato than bright fruit. Quite classical in style, blending 70% Sangiovese with 30% Cabernet. Tart cherry and cranberry control the palate, which has a nice center cut of fruit but not a lot of obvious charm. More of a connoisseur's wine than mainstream juice.",88,72,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7849","New Zealand","Having now tasted this wine on three separate occasions, I'm certain it will continue to improve in the bottle, but how stingy my current rating will ultimately seem is an open question. From tank prior to bottling, it was a rich, custardy, vibrant wine that I would have rated in the low 90s. Tasted blind after bottling, I've not yet found that same level of quality, but my ratings have climbed from low-mid 80s (back in the early part of this year) to high 80s now, as the wine seems to be regaining some of its rich, velvety texture to help balance its formidable acidity. Worth trying again in another year or two. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",88,44,"Central Otago","Chardonnay",-44.9566315,169.3988451,2
"7850","Italy","This wine is starting to round into a mature stage. The bouquet pushes light leather, forest, earth and secondary fruit aromas. Black cherry and plum work well together on the tight, mildly tannic palate, while the finish is concentrated and rewarding. Will be good with food.",88,38,"Tuscany","Merlot",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7851","Italy","Plum and blackberry coat the plump nose, backed by ripe black fruit that registers as pure but standard.

"7852","Italy","Ripe, slightly char-broiled and pure, with compact red-fruit aromas. Broader on the tongue, with tasty black cherry and blackberry. Tight and tannic, but with enough girth and glycerol to fatten it up to a balanced level.",87,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7853","Chile","Ultra ripe but balanced, with beams of black plum and cherry driving through the bouquet. Totally mature berry fruit on the palate, and loud. Juicy and racy across the tongue. Good with a steak.",88,13,"Central Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-36,-72,3
"7854","France","For lovers of Syrah, Cornas is the purest expression, with its dark, brooding tannins and heady fruit. This wine, from the Tain cooperative, is a classic Cornas, which just misses the intensity of some examples, but still has fine, dry tannins and long-lasting acidity.",88,25,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7855","Chile","In the global Cabernet market, this stylish wine scores well. Aromas of coffee, mocha and oak support plum and cassis.

Serious stuff, with depth and saturation.",88,15,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3

"7857","Australia","Cream and blackberry fruit dominates this Cab's nose; on the palate, the cream explodes into a heavy oakiness that masks the ripe fruit, and even turns it a bit tart. Too much acid on the palate and on the back end. The finish is medium-long but tart.",82,37,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7858","Australia","There's a smooth quality to the wood, berry and caramel notes on the nose of this wine, but overall it's mostly about wood, as only faint fruit hints still show. Quite mature, it feels old and somewhat tired, albeit elegantly so.",82,22,"South Australia","Merlot",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"7860","Australia","This Chard's nose has pleasing butterscotch and cream aromas (that were somehow light enough to almost smell like a Sauvignon Blanc); sadly, the rest of the wine couldn't live up to the promising bouquet. Oak is the dominant flavor on the tangy, hot palate; there's high acidity in the mouth and on the back end. Pucker, pucker.",82,25,"Victoria","Chardonnay",-37.4713077,144.7851531,2

"7864","New Zealand","New Zealand Sauvignons near the $10 mark that aren't being churned out by a huge multinational corporation are getting hard to find, but here's one example, and it's available in magnums too, which should be even more economical—provided you've got a big enough thirst or enough guests to down all that wine. This excellent value in NZ SB is a bit understated on the nose, but still offers herbal flourishes, stone fruit and citrus in a medium-bodied, well-rounded package. Picks up refreshing passion fruit notes on the finish.",87,11,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7865","Italy","From the cherry, violet and tobacco nose through the full-flavored palate, this wine hits the right notes.

"7866","Italy","Ripe black-cherry aromas with cedar and clove accents open this big yet supple wine. A mouthful of licorice and plum, wrapped in toasty menthol oak, follows. Bright acidity keeps the supple texture from becoming flabby. Full tannins and tart black-plum flavors on the finish promise a great life. Best held for two or three years.",90,25,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7867","France","Scents of dried apricots and candied citrus leap from the glass, followed by flavors of honey, pear and melon.

"7869","Italy","Full and penetrating aromas get it started, but beware of some horsehide and leather that some might term barnyard.

"7871","Italy","Nice and ripe, with sweet plum and black cherry on the open, well-padded nose. Full in the mouth, with satisfying cherry, plum and chocolate flavors. And it holds its form through the long, smooth finish. Just an easy wine to like and drink. Requires no serious contemplation.",87,19,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7872","New Zealand","Winemaker Larry McKenna's Pinots tend to be more muscular and ageworthy than this example, perhaps the result of vintage conditions rather than any stylistic change. In any event, it's a pretty, lighter-styled wine, with cherry fruit flavors enhanced by chocolate, caramel and touches of celery seed and spice. Silky and delicate in the mouth, but the flavors fade a little too quickly on the finish.",86,35,"Martinborough","Pinot Noir",-41.2190932,175.4600651,3

"7875","France","Smoky and minerally on the nose--like when you strike two pieces of flint together.

Such a vivid expression of minerality is hard to find at this price.",87,13,"Burgundy","Chardonnay",47.0525047,4.3837215,2
"7876","Chile","Full oak results in aromas of BBQ beef, chocolate and licorice. The palate is more along the lines of red fruit, with an herbal twist. The finish keeps form and the wine is balanced. Likable and easy to grasp.",87,15,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7877","France","From its aromas of black pepper and cured meats, this wine screams Syrah. Of course, it tastes like syrah too, yielding flavors of blackberries, black pepper and air-dried beef. A bit leaner and less generous on the palate than Guigal's Saint-Joseph, but still an impressive effort, with a firm  structure and modest tannins on the finish. Drink 2006–2012.",87,20,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7878","Chile","Starts raw and rugged, with overt sawdust aromas, but settles down to show spicy red fruit, licorice, leather and earth. A bit oaky, with coconut flavors along with molasses, chocolate and baked plum. Finishes on the sweet, syrupy side of the fence, but good in a meaty, modern, woody way.",87,17,"Maipo Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-33.444962,-70.648283,3
"7879","Italy","Upright, with notes of cinnamon candy on a nose dominated by bright red fruit.

The opposite of dead weight; this is a lively wine.",86,12,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7881","Italy","A lot of sulfur at first, and that creates a cloud over the nose. Underneath, however, there's quality black plum, berry and earth notes.

"7882","New Zealand","The result of a difficult vintage, CB's 2004 Pinot Noir is an attractive, pretty wine.

"7883","France","From the Côte de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait. If you dig deep you'll find some of those custard, stone and petrol nuances that give Alsace Rieslings their character.",88,19,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"7884","Australia","A bouquet of dark red fruits, black currants, tobacco, and foresty green-pepper elements announce this well-balanced wine. The cassis, dark berry and plum core bears an herbaceous mantle, but with style, in a Bordeaux-like manner. The finish is long with sweet, positive fruit and good tannins.",88,40,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7885","France","Heavy on the earth and leather, but it's all backed up nicely by clove-spiced black cherries and a lush, velvety mouthfeel. Turns a little tart and tannic on the finish, but just enough to let it age comfortably for a few years.",87,43,"Burgundy","Pinot Noir",47.0525047,4.3837215,4
"7886","Australia","Quite full and toasty, with toffee, butterscotch and tropical fruits, this wine offers lots of weight and a long finish with lemon, butter, and big oak flavors. Attractive, but the wood predominates a bit much. Future vintages will be sourced exclusively from the Padthaway vineyards.",87,29,"Australia Other","Chardonnay",-25.274398,133.775136,2

"7888","Italy","Gold in color, with a ton of oak. But you know what? It works. The resin and vanilla aromas over time become attractive, while the rich palate deals coconut, toffee and baked white fruits. Yes, it's a barrique bomber from a hot climate, but it's interesting and should go well with roast fowl or foie gras.",87,27,"Sicily & Sardinia","Chardonnay",37.5999938,14.0153557,2

"7890","Italy","Chunky, open aromas start it off, and the bouquet is likable if nothing special. Dense and grapy fruit carries the palate, surrounded by spiky tannins. An extracted Syrah with zero gamy, spicy character. This is a black, ripe wine with size but limits.",85,16,"Tuscany","Syrah",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7891","Spain","Bacon and leather meld with modest black-fruit aromas on the nose of this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bobal blend. It's fairly plump, with blackberry and vanilla flavors.

"7892","New Zealand","Light ruby in color, this wine doesn't appear to be terribly rich or concentrated. But it's a charming, soft little Pinot, intended to caress the palate rather than stun it. Sous bois and cherries are framed by barrel-derived notes of caramel, cedar and vanilla. Ends slightly woody, but should smooth out in another few months.",85,25,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"7894","France","Fresh, tight and properly crisp, there’s nothing here to put it in the California-blowsy category. Stone-fruit aromas lead into peach and green-apple flavors.

"7895","France","Is it the lucid rosy color or the exotic flavor that invokes images of a well-made cup of tea? In this unusual rendering of the world's most idiosyncratic grape, it's both. Floral, light, even dainty, it tastes of strawberries, cream and a little woody spice. For an airy, light-bodied Pinot, this one scores points for expression. The finish is lovely.",86,19,"Alsace","Pinot Noir",48.3181795,7.4416241,4

"7898","Australia","Expressive and solid; a pleasure to drink. It starts with complex aromas of pepper and boot leather mixed with flowers and berries.

"7902","Italy","From Kendall-Jackson, this Merlot is warm and toasty, with aromas of popcorn, roasted plum and leather.

"7908","New Zealand","A distinctly Burgundian-style effort, with aromas of buttered and toasted hazelnuts backed by spiced pears. Very toasty and rich, but boasts enough citrusy acidity (despite 100% malolactic fermentation) to carry it off. A five-vineyard blend from an area just outside of Auckland. World class.",91,33,"Kumeu","Chardonnay",-36.7772623,174.5588019,2
"7909","New Zealand","An adult version of Honey-Nut Cheerios? The sweet nutty and leesy aromas are reminiscent of a certain breakfast cereal. Zesty acidity and lemon-lime fruit flavors keep this rich, earthy wine from being heavy. Winemaker Michael Brajkovich seems to have a sure touch with Chardonnay.",90,40,"Kumeu","Chardonnay",-36.7772623,174.5588019,2
"7910","Australia","Right away there's a rich, secure look to this wine, and then comes attractive melon, fig and peach aromas.

"7911","New Zealand","Very ripe and soft-smelling, featuring tropical fruits, butter and vanilla. Gets more interesting in the mouth, with lime-like acidity to give it definition, and plump guavas, mangos and pineapples that caress your palate. The finish is a bit oaky, with buttered toast and vanilla overtones, but in such a hedonistic wine, a little excess only seems appropriate.",89,18,"Gisborne","Chardonnay",-38.662334,178.017649,2
"7912","Chile","Spearmint, blackberry and plum unfold on the juicy, easy nose. The palate spreads out with raspberry, red plum and licorice flavors. Lengthy and textured on the finish, with a dose of spice. Easy to drink.",86,8,"Central Valley","Merlot",-36,-72,3
"7913","France","A fresh, lightly tannic wine, with acidity, flavors of red fruits. The dry tannins are ripe and easy, with good wood flavors. It is approachable, without great complexity - a great example of this inexpensive appellation.",86,11,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7914","Italy","Gold in color and sweet, but still healthy enough to rate well. Honey, syrup and peaches carry the nose, while the palate is full of pear, banana and toasted nuts. The soft, chewy mouthfeel warns that this should be drunk soon.",86,9,"Sicily & Sardinia","Chardonnay",37.5999938,14.0153557,2

"7917","New Zealand","Has a pretty appearance and bouquet, with a ruby red color and sappy scents of herbs and raspberry, but doesn't quite measure up on the palate, where it's rather light and fluid, with herbal flavors only just buffered by pretty cherry notes. Picks up slightly bitter chocolate notes on the finish.",84,17,"Marlborough","Pinot Noir",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7918","Italy","Ripe to the point of raisiny, with milk chocolate and berry jam on the nose. The palate mixes the sweetness of liqueur with core tartness, and the final result isn't overly impressive. Leaves a shallow imprint at the finish line.",84,43,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7919","New Zealand","If you are turned off by heavily oaked Chards, this is one to consider. It's loaded with light tropical-fruit aromas and flavors, along with a nice hint of peach. It's a little lower in acidity and verve than the excellent '98, but it's solid, and blossoms in the glass. A very practical, easy-to-drink wine.",89,15,"Marlborough","Chardonnay",-41.57269,173.4216613,2
"7920","New Zealand","This one falls squarely into the white-grapefruit and lime category. Quite herbal, with an outright green streak in the midpalate. Good tropical-fruit core, and round. Easy to drink, not piercing, and a little metallic. There's a basil-oregano note to the finish.",88,15,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7921","New Zealand","A unique bouquet of honey and tangerines suggests that very ripe fruit went into this succulent wine. Subtle vanilla notes add a creamy feel, and it finishes with bright citrus flavors. This is a big, fruit-forward wine that should be drunk over the next year or two.",87,20,"Marlborough","Chardonnay",-41.57269,173.4216613,2

"7923","New Zealand","This label has grown so quickly, perhaps a slight downturn in quality was inevitable. The 2005 is still a good wine, but doesn't show quite the interest of the previous two vintages. Passion fruit and pineapple aromas and flavors are a bit simple, carried by a slightly syrupy mouthfeel (7.7 g/L residual sugar).",84,20,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3

"7926","New Zealand","Soft and jam-packed with sweet and snappy strawberry and rhubarb aromas. The flavors are similar and are buffeted by a refreshing cool herbal streak.

If you like blazing fruit, this is it; for something steely and minerally, look to Germany.",87,12,"Marlborough","Riesling",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7928","Australia","The elegant, spice-driven nose makes a positive initial impression, and the body and flavors do a decent job of sustaining it. It's a little light in the midpalate, but there are ample black-cherry flavors and smoky oak. An extremely competent wine from Len Evans, a figure in modern Australian wine lore. Best Buy.",87,12,"Victoria","Cabernet Sauvignon",-37.4713077,144.7851531,3
"7929","New Zealand","A very herbaceous nose and lean grapefruit and gooseberry flavor profile make this a fairly textbook rendition of this certain style of Sauvignon Blanc.

Very alive, and not a wine people will be ambivalent about.",87,16,"Marlborough","Sauvignon Blanc",-41.57269,173.4216613,3
"7930","Australia","You get the better parts of both worlds here: It's both classy and casual. If it's slightly austere on its own, with sharpness and palate-scrubbing acids, just place some spicy food alongside it and you're home free. Ginger chicken is a particularly good match. The lemon-lime fruit is accented by slate and petrol. It's more of a food wine than a simple sipper.",86,12,"South Australia","Riesling",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"7932","Australia","Another solid vintage for Bin 65, one of the brands that for many people is synonymous with popular-priced Aussie Chardonnay.

Flavorful and affordable, and widely available.",86,10,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"7933","New Zealand","From a Napa producer with an outpost in New Zealand. Australian-born Gerald Rowland's wine has a lovely nose of cherries, beets, cola, and green herbs.

"7934","Chile","Full and chunky, with a nose of corn cakes, melon and a touch of pickled oak. Banana, mango and melon flavors are sweet and candied, but just enough acidity keeps it on an even keel. Good, but with a sugary side to it.",85,10,"Colchagua Valley","Chardonnay",-34.6761419,-71.097317,2
"7935","France","Starts off well, blending aromas of smoke, mineral and diesel with lime and pineapple, then delivers tropical and citrus fruits on the palate. Stumbles at the finish, which is short and not as impressively concentrated as some of Albrecht's other bottlings.",85,86,"Alsace","Riesling",48.3181795,7.4416241,4
"7936","Italy","A low-oak Chard (15%, the rest sees only stainless), this wine boasts a plump, appealing texture and scents of pear and citrus. Brings in some peachy flavors, then turns tangy and fresh on the finish, folding in hints of orange and lemon.",85,9,"Sicily & Sardinia","Chardonnay",37.5999938,14.0153557,2
"7937","Chile","Lean and spicy, with some green in the middle of the nose that's similar to celery. Additional bell pepper hangs heavily on the palate, but there's just enough berry to offset it. Tight in terms of feel, with well-integrated tannins. Feels nice; tastes more herbal than ideal.",85,12,"Colchagua Valley","Cabernet Sauvignon",-34.6761419,-71.097317,3
"7938","Chile","Fairly smoky, with aromas of campfire and roasted corn. Woody on the palate, but also plenty of citrus in the form of lemon and orange. Consistent throughout, meaning the wood resin influence is primary.",85,25,"Maipo Valley","Chardonnay",-33.444962,-70.648283,2
"7939","Chile","Heavy and ripe, with some burnt, charred oak. Flavors of plum, berry and rhubarb are soft and round, with coffee and chocolate notes to the finish. Fits the bill.",84,11,"Curicó Valley","Merlot",-34.9859489,-71.2417746,3
"7940","Italy","Berry and bacon aromas are marred by a strong pickled overtone. The tangy palate is thin and full of ripping berry notes that are surfing on wiry acidity. Almost citrusy on the finish.",82,12,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3
"7941","Italy","Rusty in color, with tree bark and mulch on the nose. As for the fruit, it has mostly left the building. Thus what remains is stewy and soft.",81,18,"Tuscany","Sangiovese",43.7710513,11.2486208,3

"7943","Australia","Here's a very interesting Chard packed with citrus, tropical fruit, and spice, and just the right touch of toasty oak.  One caveat: The acidity is very high, and some may find it tart, even sour.  Others will appreciate the structure.",85,7,"Australia Other","Chardonnay",-25.274398,133.775136,2
"7944","Australia","Very bright, even sharp, this unoaked (Aquercus means without oak) Chardonnay reads very much like a Sauvignon Blanc. Aromas of grass, lime and grapefruit, like flavors, and a lean, crisply acidic profile make this wine appealing, but quite different from the archetype Australian Chardonnay Americans are used to. Great zing, but a different thing.",85,10,"Western Australia","Chardonnay",-27.6728168,121.6283098,2
"7945","Australia","Full aromas of peach, pears, and toast open this very straightforward (and very successful over the last decade) Aussie Chardonnay. Good mouthfeel. Apple, mild tropical-fruit and toast flavors make it a winner. Solid and quite widely available, if perhaps a touch hotter and less well-defined than in its best years.",85,12,"Australia Other","Chardonnay",-25.274398,133.775136,2
"7946","Australia","Pulsating honey and pear aromas announce the sweetness that follows. Like many Aussie Chards, this is a huge mouthful of pineapple, banana and other tropical fruits. A touch of welcome bitterness offers some balance to the heavy finish.",84,10,"South Australia","Chardonnay",-30.0002315,136.2091547,2
"7947","Australia","A little damp-smelling, with mushroom, mint and chocolate aromas, but not much fruit. It takes an extremely long time to open up, and even then the tail end of the palate—both flavor and feel—is sharp. The fruit falls into the cranberry-and-cherry range.",83,15,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7948","Australia","Blueberries dominate the dense, sweet nose. Flavors are a bit sharp: plums, currants and wintergreen are identifiable. Very full-bodied, with oodles of black fruit, but ultimately a bit plain and simple.",83,23,"South Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3
"7949","Chile","A bit herbal, and doesn't show the same level of flavor intensity or mouthfeel that the Cabernet does. It still delivers varietal black cherry and mocha flavors, but finishes with tart flavors and lots of fresh herbs.",84,10,"Casablanca Valley","Merlot",-33.3190376,-71.4076318,3
"7950","France","Modest cherry and herbal-stemmy aromas give way to lean cherry flavors on the palate. It seems a little dilute and underripe, which could be a result of the vintage. Decent, but leaves one wishing for more power.",84,19,"Rhône Valley","Syrah",44.0574025,4.828508,4
"7951","France","Gorgeous, concentrated, ripe fruit show both the quality of this wine and the extra warmth of 2005. The MD is the top cuvée from the Bourgeois vineyard.

"7952","France","Masson-Blondelet has produced a sumptuous wine from the softer soils of Pouilly.

"7953","France","This is one of two terroir-based wines from Masson-Blondelet, coming from very minerally soil. It is fresh, taut, tight and packed with poised fruit.

"7955","France","There aren't many aristocratic estates in the largely peasant-based culture of Pouilly. But this is one, and it's old, dating back to 1396. The Estutt d'Assay family makes one wine, an estate wine: This 2004 has great elegance, not hugely rich, but with fine, pure fruit flavors that are already well balanced. There's roundness from the terroir of Tract-sur-Loire as well as a streak of fine acidity. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",91,35,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"7956","France","Named after Alphonse Mellot's son, this beautifully crafted top cuvée is produced from old vines, yielding a full body with a touch of wood that doesn't mask the fresh acidity, just softens it.

"7957","Australia","Delicious, precise and excellent, but this Riesling isn't built to satisfy the masses. Its acidity is scouring and it gives the wine a tartness that makes your mouth water. Aromas are dusty and delicate, and flavors stay the lime and green grape track. Worth seeking out, but don't judge it on that first mouthpuckering sip. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars.",91,22,"Western Australia","Riesling",-27.6728168,121.6283098,3
"7958","Australia","A steak lover's Cab made in an old-school style, sturdy but not brash. Has its share of oak, to be sure, but it's the “dry tannins and black pepper flavors” kind, not the toast-and-nut route. Red plum and cherry fruit are at its firm core. Enjoyable and traditional.

"7960","France","From old vines, this intensely flavored wine is deliciously ripe, a product of the hot summer of 2005, but retains the essential acidity and citrus flavors of good Sancerre. Packed with fruit now, it will soften, ripen and gain almond layers that will give it even more complexity. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",90,20,"Loire Valley","Sauvignon Blanc",47.5532402,1.0105289,4
"7961","Italy","Smoky, toasty and earthy, this still needs a little time to fully integrate its two years in oak.

"7969","Austria","The most flattering of Prager's 2004 smaragds to taste now, thanks to greater weight in the midpalate and riper fruit flavors that flirt with peach and melon while being firmly anchored by citrus and mineral. Hints of Earl Grey tea and stone dust garnish the nose. Drink now or hold.",89,42,"Wachau","Riesling",48.3896089,15.4748897,3

"7973","Austria","An oily, viscous wine the color of polished brass, Malat's 2002 auslese boasts striking scents of honey, peaches and orange marmalade. The ultraripe peach flavors pick up hints of spice and nuts on the finish.

"7974","Austria","Flashier on the nose than on the palate, starting with traces of almond, melon and dried spices but moving into flavors of herbs and citrus.

"7975","Australia","A nice, enjoyable wine as it always is, but seems broader, rounder and less from a single place than it has in the past.

"7977","Austria","Loaded with citrus, this Riesling is full in the mouth, yet not soft at all—possessed of a firm backbone of acids and minerals.

"7979","Australia","A surprising sort of Sauvignon in that it doesn't start out like much, but really deserves a second (or third) look. Mineral and melon aromas and a dilute, almost heavy feel is what you get right off. After a few sips, the intensity builds up, and flavors of citrus zest, mineral and fresh herb emerge. 1,400 cases produced.",88,16,"South Australia","Sauvignon Blanc",-30.0002315,136.2091547,3

"7984","Australia","The Prelude Vineyards Chard typically seems a soft-edged, full wine to me—this year it's even more so.

"7985","France","In 2003, Schlumberger only bottled one grand cru Riesling, leaving the fruit from Saering and Kessler to help beef up this wine.

"7988","Argentina","Solid from start to finish, with bramble and spice on the nose along with ripe plum and berry compote.

"8170","US","Offered in a half-bottle size, this estate Cab-based wine also contains 6% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot.

"8229","US","As is often the case with Oregon's 2011 Pinots, this remains stubbornly tight, and shows herbal and stem flavors rather than pretty fruit.

"8298","US","Blended from several stellar vineyard sites, including La Cruz and Devoto, this wine presents a brightness of acidity and crisp, red fruit.

"8323","US","The high alcohol may be a stumbling block for some palates, but this wine is nonetheless absolutely delicious. Sourced from a vineyard planted in 1972, it was aged in 50% new French oak. It's intense and detailed, with hints of wintergreen, a broad streak of cherry cola, and finishing licks of molasses, brown sugar and coffee.",92,28,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"8324","US","Slightly shy aromas of blackberry, black plum and turned black soil are simple and straightforward on this wine.

A sip enlivens the mouth and wipes clean on the finish.",90,60,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"8325","US","Cabernet Sauvignon is blessed with 9% Merlot, coming together in a seamlessly rich wine intense in dark chocolate, coconut and vanilla. Soft, the tannins are integrated and the juiciness of the fruit concentrated, finishing with more of that rich taste of chocolate.",90,75,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"8326","US","This bottling offers plum and plump blackberry on the nose along with milk chocolate, leather and cedar.

"8327","US","From a fourth-generation farming family, this wine is sourced from the Niebaum-Tonella and Morisoli-Borges vineyards along the Rutherford Bench.

"8330","US","There's a slightly sour, forest-floor funkiness to the nose of this wine from an historic appellation near Hollister.

"8334","US","This rich, almost sweet wine owes a lot of its exuberance to the flavors that oak barrels impart—toasted, smoky, seemingly sweet but not sugary notes like maple syrup. Ripe black cherry and boysenberry flavors blend in too. The mouthfeel is dense but not harsh, as the layers of fine-textured tannins add shape without a lot of weight.",88,22,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"8338","US","The lightly delicate mouthfeel and brisk acidity testify to the wine's origins in cool-climate Marin, just over the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.

"8340","US","This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region.

"8344","US","Deep and rich aromas of blackberry syrup and wet slate kick off this excellent, approachable representation of Santa Barbara County's new Ballard Canyon appellation. It's both juicy and tannic once sipped, tasty with blackberry and slight cherry juice. Balanced with medium-range force, it provides evidence of how the region evens out Syrah's rougher edges.",91,38,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"8345","US","The winery's larger-scale Syrah (and that's still under 2,000 cases), this is a friendly, sophisticated Rhône-inspired wine grown on the cooler Sonoma Coast.

"8349","US","Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal. High in acidity and tannin, it takes time in the glass to settle down and find its balance, with a lengthy finish of black licorice and clove.",90,70,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"8566","US","This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.",85,25,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"8567","US","This has a rather deep red color and a slightly smoky rim. It offers profuse aromas of black cherry and blackberry, medium to full body and a generous texture.

"8573","US","In this 2012 reserve, the fruit is sourced entirely from the Black Family estate vineyard.

"8582","US","Charred beef tips, grilled whole fish, wet dirt and heavy tar combine for a pungent, serious nose on this Syrah from a vineyard planted by Central Coast pioneer Dale Hampton.

"8585","US","This powerful Cabernet Sauvignon calls on 13% Malbec to further its brawn, the mix spending two years in entirely new French oak.

"8591","US","With a sizable presence on the nose and a palate evocative of black cherry, strawberry compote and orange peel, this wine speaks volumes in terms of texture and body.

"8635","US","Notes of cinnamon and peppercorns adds complexity to the cranberry-pomegranate fruit and slate minerality on the nose of this single-vineyard expression.

Nonetheless the structure and gravitas suggests a wine that will age.",92,55,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"8972","US","Roasted macadamia, toasted coconut and baked apple scents lead the nose of this wine from Santa Barbara County's first commercial vineyard.

"8973","US","Blue fruit character comes softly layered with exotic clove and cardamom scents in this elegantly light and vibrant wine.

"8975","US","From a south-facing hillside site on the edge of the Petaluma Gap at Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard, this fruity and complex wine shows white pepper and earthy notes, taking time to open in the glass.

"8977","US","Dijon clones go into this rich mouth coating wine.

"8978","US","This reserved and classically styled wine has subtle fig and marzipan aromas, is dry on the palate, with a bundle of tight fruit and spice flavors wound up in fresh acidity that emerge slowly with each sip and on the finish.

"8987","US","Notable for a soft, buttery creaminess that makes it feel caressing in the mouth.

"8988","US","It shows good acidity, a pleasant scour of tannins and complex flavors of raspberries, currants and mushrooms. But a tannic graininess results in a lack of delicacy. Already throwing some sediment, it will age for many years.",87,60,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"8989","US","This is one of those Chardonnays that's delicious from the first sip.

"8998","US","Intense tannins and full body make this Syrah difficult to savor at this point, but it may round out with aging.

"9007","US","From this particular block all the vines are the Pommard clone, which keeps it distinctive from the other Shea cuvées.

"9055","US","Soft and ultra-smooth, this is crafted in a drink-now style that holds considerable appeal. Lightly spiced purple fruits are in place, and a hint of a vegetal note is almost invisible.

"9069","US","This hides its 37 g/L residual sugar with bracing acidity and overall complexity.

"9090","US","This Dundee Hills vineyard really shines in 2012, with multi-layered flavors of sweet, spicy, slightly candied fruits.

"9126","US","White flowers, spun honey and graham cracker aromas introduce this wine that will be a hit with those who prefer a sweet touch to their bottles.

"9307","US","This wine is tight and tannic, with a rustic hint of leathery saddle and barnyard that makes it hard to highly recommend.",82,25,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9308","US","This wine is a blend of top sites Les Collines, SJR and Red Willow. It's perfumed with notes of green olive, violets, dried herbs, mineral and smoked meat. The palate is tightly wound, sensuous and supple, lithe yet rich with tart fruit and savory flavors backed by tannins that need more time to come into their own—but this wine surely deserves it. It has all of the stuffing to be a 20+ year wine. Best from 2025 to 2032. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term.",95,85,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"9310","US","The sweet smell of campfire meets with bacon fat, dried purple flowers, black tea, licorice, espresso and just a razor's edge of ripe fruit. It's delicious on the palate, with rich raspberry fruits, dried strawberry, mocha and a minty sensation that lingers amidst the noticeable tannic grip.",94,50,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9311","US","Minty fresh and significantly herbal, this is a lighter-styled, stemmy and earthy wine from a longstanding vineyard source that just shines from start to finish.

"9312","US","Suave aromas of browned butter, preserved lemons and seared nectarine surround alkalinity on this purely-for-the-love side project of Jim Clendenen. The edges of the palate are lush and rich with vanilla cream, roasted nuts and butter, but the center holds laser-tight to singed lemon acidity before a finish that shows some marshmallow and nutmeg spice. The wine seems to be peaking now.",94,50,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9313","US","Offering aromas of a warm berry cobbler with a touch of sagebrush spice, this delivers the flavorful balance promised by the appellation.

"9314","US","Numerous sites in the Horse Heaven Hills didn't produce fruit in 2011 due a late 2010 freeze. This wine bears witness to the glory of the vines that survived unscathed with its notes of huckleberry, dark coffee and smoked meat.

"9316","US","In 1996, Dan and Donna Lee planted the Double L Vineyard, believing it to be the best place to produce a great wine in the appellation.

"9321","US","Round Pond's track record with Sauvignon Blanc is pretty consistent. The wine is rarely great—almost never bad–but frequently satisfactory.

"9322","US","There's a toughness to this wine that makes it a little hard to appreciate. The tannins are raw, and there's a green, herbal quality to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The oak seems to stand aside, and so does the acidity. It's all a bit ungainly now and is unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.",86,60,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"9327","US","Williams Selyem expresses the intricacies of this vineyard with more consistency than any other winery. This remarkably intellectual, ageworthy wine is bone dry, with marked acidity and complexity. The flavors range from wild cherries, cola and balsam to raspberry tart and buttered cinnamon toast.

A softly tannic bitterness lingers on the finish; drink 2019–2030.",97,95,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9328","US","As with previous vintages, this rare wine spent 38 months in barrel. Smooth and supple, it's a lush expression of purple and black fruits, generously endowed with darker flavors of smoke, tar, soy and licorice. There is a compelling, yet subtle, umami character overriding all else. It's drinking quite beautifully now, but could age considerably longer.",96,100,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"9330","US","This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley.",97,125,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9331","US","This is an amazingly complex wine and a fine expression of the cool vintage. Perhaps the most notable feature is acidity; it's strong, almost tingly, and will certainly help the wine age. The flavors are explosive yet refined, with notes of cherries, cola, pomegranates and plums. Good as it is to drink now, you'll want to cellar it until 2018, and it will provide beauty for many additional years.",95,57,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9332","US","Tantara's nine new Pinot Noirs are all fabulous, but the Gwendolyn is their best. It is, in a word, gorgeous. Brisk in acidity, balanced in alcohol and oak, it displays a complex array of flavors, ranging from black cherries and cola to pomegranates, rhubarbs, persimmons and sweet currants. For all the power, it feels as delicate as a rose petal. Drink this lush wine now and over the next 10 years.",95,70,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9333","US","Shows the power and finesse of this great vineyard. The cherry, persimmon, cola and baking spice flavors have the exotically feral notes of chamomile, game and mushrooms so typical of this vineyard and the Fort Ross area.

"9334","US","Merry Edwards has had a long relationship with this Westside Road vineyard, which has given her some very great wines. This 2010 continues her offering of delicious Pinots of early appeal, but whose structural integrity guarantees ageability.

"9340","US","Dusty leather, cedar and pencil shaving notes integrate seamlessly with the moderate oak and firm tannins of this wine from a vineyard originally planted by Robert Pepi.

"9342","US","A wondrous bottling of delicately handled, incredibly complex wine, this bottling shows tangy cranberry, black raspberry, butter cookie, wet sage, rosemary, menthol and green peppercorn on the nose.

"9344","US","This exotic Cabernet Sauvignon, which is aged entirely in new French oak, needs time to develop.

"9347","US","A wine that begs for time in the bottle, it stubbornly reveals bold, brawny and rich notes of black cherry, coffee and black pepper, girded by a strong presence of dark chocolate.

"9348","US","This wine is no shrinking violet on the nose, resplendent in fresh roses and strawberry-raspberry.

"9349","US","This wine is a blend of four distinctive sites—Minick and Olsen in the Yakima Valley, and SJR and Stoney Vine in the Walla Walla Valley. It pulls together the best of all of them, with brooding notes of mineral, wet stone, earthy funk, coffee, smoked meat and black and green olive.

"9353","US","This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used.

"9362","US","The black, inky color of this Syrah only begins to suggest its power. The first sip explodes with flavors of melted dark chocolate and crème de cassis, sprinkled with black pepper.

"9368","US","Amazingly rich and voluptuous, this shows none of the rustic edges that can sometimes plague Malbec. It's concentrated in blackberry jam and black currant flavors, with a jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is high, but not overbearing.

You have to search for the richness—buried so deeply now—but it's there, like a pirate treasure of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur.

"9379","US","This broad-shouldered, burly and feral wine is ripe with smoky cherry and vanilla notes. Smoothly textured, it imparts dusty leather and black licorice accents amid a serious slathering of oak.",88,75,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9380","US","Proving one of the more reliable affordably priced brands from the region, this bottling offers fresh jasmine, tangerine pith, crushed chalk and pineapple aromas.

"9382","US","Concentrated, jammy fruit flavors meet full body and sturdy tannins in this well-made wine. It has a large presence due to alcoholic strength and the ripe spectrum of its fruit flavors, which includes raisin, black cherry and dried fig. Yet, tannins and acidity provide a firm texture that keeps it feeling balanced.",90,38,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9383","US","Just three barrels were made of this rather unusual wine. It's a seemingly disparate mix of raspberries, gun metal, dried seaweed and carpaccio, yet somehow it all comes together. The length is impressive. This is one of those wines that will thrill some tasters and puzzle others.",90,48,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"9384","US","This reserve-series wine opens in honeysuckle, offering a wealth of floral aromas before unveiling a backbone of caramel oak. Starting fresh and crisp in acidity and citrus, it evolves in the glass to become richer and more unctuous in texture, with a boldness of baked apple.",90,60,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9385","US","Earthy cherry and cardamom seize the palate at first, before a tang of pomegranate and cranberry sneaks in to provide freshness and minerality. Tannic in its youth, this medium-bodied red also offers a minty note of black tea.",90,56,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9386","US","This wine is somewhat diluted and one-dimensional. It makes a straightforward attempt at bringing a richness of apple and anise to the fore around neutral oak dynamics before finishing ripe and full.",84,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9387","US","This wine, aged in stainless steel barrels, offers muted berry fruit, somewhat masked by aromas of rubber tire and plastic. The finish is short and slightly bitter.",84,26,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3

"9389","US","Klopp is a mix of California and Burgundy clones, one of the producer's finest offerings every year, made in an opulent, balanced style. Lush layers of strawberry and cherry are surrounded by truffle-like dirt. The wine is concentrated in tannin and subtle oak, while anise marks the measured finish. The wine will benefit from time in the cellar through 2020.",93,60,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9390","US","This is a limited-production offering from a tiny appellation, blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot.

"9391","US","Norm Yost named this wine after his wife. It shows rich, deep and mysterious aromas, from dried rose petals and cherries to funky mushrooms, fresh-cut sagebrush, maple and damp wood.

This Pinot could handle a big steak.",93,55,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9392","US","Made from both grapes directly pressed into wine as well as bled off, this crisply complex offering is springtime in a glass, a soft and supple evoking of fresh-cut pineapple that remains dry and delicious without ever overreaching.

"9394","US","For the first time these excellent grapes are being shown in a single-vineyard cuvée. It's a big, tannic, high-octane wine, with smooth, ripe and generous purple fruits. There is plenty of supporting acid, along with rather astringent tannins that carry a leafy note through the finish. Drink now–2019.",91,30,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"9398","US","Here's a bone dry, tannic, full-bodied Cabernet. It's packed with cassis flavors that define the essence of Cabernet. But it is very astringent. Will it age? The best guess is no, due to a certain thinness, so give it a long decanting and drink now.",85,30,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"9401","US","If you can only cellar one Sonoma Pinot Noir from the 2011 vintage, make it this one. It's a big, tight wine with strong tannins, but somehow never loses sight of Pinot's essential delicacy. Despite the dryness, the wine has a luscious core of raspberries, red currants, cola and rhubarbs, along with subtle oak influences. Do not touch this wine before 2017, although it should still be going strong 15 years from now.",94,75,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9402","US","This small-production Chardonnay (only 272 cases) is exceptionally rich and ripe, as Williams Selyem Chardonnays consistently are. Intense flavors of tropical fruit and pear pie (with a smoky, buttery crust) make for a powerful palate. The acidity is mouthwatering.

"9407","US","This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean.

It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,39,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9408","US","Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering.

"9409","US","Testarossa has the Chardonnay formula dialed in. It's always about brilliant acidity, perfect ripeness and tasteful application of oak.

"9410","US","A signature bottling from the relatively new appellation, this Sashi Moorman wine shows fresh-pressed boysenberry, black raspberry, dried violets and lavender on the zesty nose.

"9412","US","Matching tart red fruit to the vineyard's characteristic gun-metal minerality, the wine cloaks itself in a light coat of ash and stone.

"9414","US","High in acidity and well-defined minerality, this wine is also soft and velvety, with a sensibility of crushed rocks and preserved lemon.

"9419","US","This full-bodied rosé uses the 777 clone from a vineyard on the eastern edge of the Willamette valley, in an area known locally as Pete's Mountain. The Dowsett Family originally owned the Charles Coury property and started Laurel Ridge. Chris Dowsett is the winemaker at Buty as well as handling his own project. This offers a lush symphony of fruits—orange, grapefruit, pineapple and peach.

"9420","US","This wine blends in Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah and Malbec, reining in the bold, tart red fruit to create a medium-bodied, softly textured palate with a leathery backbone.

"9423","US","Brian Loring makes this spicy wine from a vineyard in the hills overlooking Highway 101 east of Nipomo. Cinnamon powder pumps up aromas of pomegranate, saddle leather and raspberry.

"9425","US","Herbal mint and strawberry counterbalance the density of oak and tannin that is the foundation of this wine.

"9426","US","Winemaker Adam Lee goes big on this bottling from the vineyard planted by the two Garys (Pisoni and Franscioni), showing bacon fat, blackberries and graphite on the nose.

"9428","US","The nose on this wine is both subtle and deep, showing dried rose petals, cherry kirsch, black currants and a hint of elderberry.

"9431","US","At first, there's a slight green herb funkiness of sharp dill on the nose of this single-vineyard offering from the Jackson Family-owned Cambria brand, where Santa Maria native Denise Shurtleff has made the wine since 1999.

"9432","US","This big-boned Cabernet tastes rich, complex and inviting. It combines cinnamon and cedar aromas, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors and a firm, tannic texture that will love a grilled lamb chop or similar flavorful fare.

"9433","US","Sourced from the Crawford vineyard in Washington's Yakima Valley, this inexpensive Syrah seems a bit stripped.

"9438","US","Is this Pinot so delicious now you should drink it right away? Or is it deceptively ageable? Both.

"9439","US","This is an amazing Syrah. Few in the history of California have been this dramatically rich and ripe with flavors of blueberries, blackberries, chocolate, currants, cedar and baking spices.

"9444","US","This has impressive flavors of cherry pie filling, red currants, cola and cocoa, plus notable oak influence and tart, mouthwatering acidity.

"9447","US","This treads the line between slightly rustic and refined. The tannins are sandpapery, and it has lots of zingy acidity, making the wine feel a little rough.

"9537","US","A bit tough and gritty, with a less-than-ripe green tomato flavor alongside the notes of cherry and pomegranate. Oaky richness adds sweetness and texture to this wine.

"9541","US","The producer's high mark for excellence, this opaque, thickly tannic wine begs for more time in the bottle.

"9574","US","Don't look for sunny California fruit in this wine. It's barely ripe, with green, gooseberry flavors barely breaking into nectarines.

"9580","US","A savory nose of roasted red pepper and marinated black olives makes this wine from the Santa Ynez Valley's first estate winery stand out from the crowd. There are green elements that some may consider unwanted, but the round, peppery spiciness makes for an intriguing, distinctive palate. This would go well with a New York strip and could stand up to prime rib with horseradish.",90,20,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9581","US","From 100% estate-grown fruit, it spent more than a year in 100% French oak and is dense in baked strawberry, black cherry and a richness of herb.

"9585","US","Heavy, oaky and fruity now, but it's a young Cabernet, and all the signs point to ageability.

"9586","US","The winery's best Hilltops in years, dry and elegantly structured.

"9595","US","This expertly structured wine will last for ages. It begins with dense blackberry jam, caramel, vanilla, fresh licorice and chocolate-ganache aromas.

"9598","US","This is a standout wine for the vintage, but it's too immature to fully appreciate now. The palate is ripe and rich with cherry and raspberry flavors touched with a briary, sappy aroma.

"9612","US","Blueberries and purple fruits get distinct seasoning from maple syrup, licorice, crushed Italian herbs and minerality in this wine from the underappreciated Cuyama Valley.

"9613","US","Hailing mostly from renowned Les Collines (44%) and Lewis (41%) vineyards and rounded out by up-and-comer Stoney Vine, this wine isn't fully ready to reveal its aromatic charms. Notes of dried herb, green olive, licorice, earth and boysenberry are out in front of brooding blue and red fruit. The flavors, however, are in full bloom, with palate-coating, focused and almost creamy cherry and plum notes that persist on the finish.",92,45,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9614","US","This cool-vintage wine saw just 10% new oak, putting the fruit front and center with aromas of smoke, freshly ground black pepper and whiffs of bacon fat.

"9623","US","Cabernet Sauvignon is 75% of the blend, with the other four Bordeaux varieties making up the rest. Scents of Bourbon barrel greet you upon opening.

"9625","US","California Chardonnays can be quite interesting after a few years in the bottle, and this 2009 screwcap is a great example.

"9633","US","This Pinot's acidity, tannins and juvenile fruit suggest time in the cellar. It's rich in raspberries, plums and cherries, with the interesting note of sweet heirloom tomato you sometimes get from Carneros. The narrow window of drinkability is 2015–2017.",91,60,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9634","US","Most Pinot Noirs would kill to have this depth of flavor. Although it's the winery's most basic, non-vineyard-designated Pinot, it's a fantastic wine, rich, mellow and delicious. Offers wave after wave of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates and persimmons that are as sweet as jam, yet the finish is thoroughly dry. The wine is a masterful blend of seven vineyards.

"9637","US","The most floral of Ponzi's single-vineyard Pinots, this is a delicate and yet powerful wine, scented with lavender and roses, and displaying bright, clean raspberry fruit.

"9638","US","Tart cranberry acidity marks this dry, delicately structured young wine. Dusty with tannins, the mouthfeel is tight and nervous.

"9643","US","This vintage sparkler is made via méthode Champenoise, though true Champagnes get much more aging prior to release. But here you find the exuberant fruit of Oregon done in a brut style.

"9689","US","It's rare to find estate-grown, Willamette Valley Pinot, from a vineyard in high demand, made by a top-tier winemaker, at this price. Still young, tight and tart, this is a very pretty wine, with tangy cherry fruit, a touch of rhubarb pie, and plenty of acidity. Another year or two of bottle age would be optimal.",89,25,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3

"9691","US","Roasted beef and pork aromas are interspersed with cherry, blackberry, black currant, dried herbs and just enough cooked bell pepper to know it's a Cab.

"9693","US","Strawberry blossoms are cut by a darker undercurrent of juniper, pencil lead and redwood on this nose of this wine from a special corner of the family estate.

"9694","US","Rich and thick, this is an opulent offering of dark cherry and Asian spice, the spice popping on the palate throughout the long finish.

"9695","US","A heady mixture of lemon custard and baked pear marks the entry to this full-bodied, deliciously decadent wine, from a high-elevation site above the Petaluma Gap.

"9698","US","This wine is sanguine and elegant despite its full-figured size. Dried cranberry and cassis play on the palate, streaked by an elusive hit of white pepper.

"9705","US","Fermented in stainless steel and concrete, this Sauvignon Blanc packs some pungency on the nose, with aromas of green coffee bean, drying grass, peach yogurt and ripe apricot.

"9708","US","Intensely aromatic, with loads of sunny peach, apricot and yellow flower aromas, this off-dry Riesling is ripe and concentrated, yet impeccably structured.

"9710","US","This is pretty tasty in cherries, cola and licorice, with a nice, silky texture. It's a polished wine that finishes dry and spicy, with a sweet oak note on the finish.

"9715","US","This unfiltered wine is cloudy in the glass and rides the low alcohol, low ripeness movement, showing a tangy nose of green olive, tart cranberry and herbaceous peppercorns.

"9716","US","A jump forward in quality for this pure Tempranillo. It opens with a dark, smoky nose—oaky but compelling.

"9721","US","Bandit's wines come in one liter cartons, so you get an extra one third of a bottle, and also do a lot of good things for the environment, as the packaging relentlessly explains.

"9724","US","Some will criticize this Chardonnay for being too oaky and sweet, but it sure is delicious.

"9725","US","There's a good wine in here, but it needs some time to escape the cage of hard tannins and primary fruit.

"9734","US","Winemaker Morten Hallgren harnesses a traditional Italian grape-drying technique called appassimento to create this richly concentrated but dry Chardonnay.

"9735","US","A warm earthiness evocative of black truffles and damp soil seduces on the nose and palate of this North Fork Cab.

"9737","US","This is a single-vineyard wine, sourced from Luminous Hills. A sharp slightly bitter stem flavor underscores tart berry fruit.

"9738","US","This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together.

"9746","US","Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like.

"9750","US","Long Island has never been known for Riesling, but you can credit Roman Roth for finally breaking that mold. This wine was made from tiny, seedless (hence, virgin) Riesling grapes that ripen earlier, and with greater sugar concentration than typical grapes. It's fragrant with lime zest and white flowers on the nose, while intoxicatingly concentrated in white grapefruit and stone fruit flavors. Layered with minerality and strikingly balanced, it's a groundbreaking achievement for the region.",91,32,"New York","Riesling",40.7127753,-74.0059728,3
"9751","US","Earthy spice and black and white pepper open the palate on this wine, a savory, tart expression of black tea and cranberry-rhubarb.

"9755","US","Tropical on the nose with lots of melon, guava and pineapple, this is reminiscent of fruit cocktail on both the nose and palate.

A flamboyant wine made in a popularly appealing style.",89,26,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9765","US","A big Pinot Noir, rich and extracted, and lacking delicacy at this time. It's as full-bodied as a Rhône blend, with jammy cherry, blueberry and spice flavors, enriched by lots of sweet new oak. Delicious, yes, if you care to drink it now. Try cellaring for four or five years to see if it mellows.",89,65,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"9770","US","This is a sturdy, well-made wine that is truly great for the price. It delivers the hearty texture and classic sage, black olive and black cherry flavors of the grape.

"9856","US","Another fine vintage for the widely available Columbia Valley Sauvignon Blanc from Ste. Michelle. This tangy bottle of ripe fruit has juicy, fleshy citrus, grapefruit and green apple flavors. Done in 80% stainless steel, with no discernable malolactic, gives a wine with plenty of acid and a lip-smacking finish.",88,10,"Washington","Sauvignon Blanc",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9857","US","From a Yountville vineyard, this Malbec has certain similarities to the Argentinian version that made the variety popular. It's inky black, tannic and utterly dry, with earthy flavors of blackberries, plums, baker's chocolate and pepper. Cries out for grilled steaks and chops.",88,48,"California","Malbec",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9858","US","Very dry, acidic and minerally, this is not one of those lush, decadent Chardonnays. It shows controlled flavors of citrus fruits, pears, wet stones and spices. The malolactic fermentation was prevented, giving it tangy acidity. Give it a try with shellfish and roast salmon.",88,35,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9859","US","Shows the zesty dryness you want in a Sauvignon Blanc, at a good price. Backed up with crisp acidity, the wine brims with clean flavors of limes, grapefruits, Meyer lemons, minerals and peppery spices.",87,11,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9860","US","A really nice Riesling that sommeliers should scoop up.

"9862","US","This is always a gigantic wine, and its success depends on technically balancing its various parts. The 2010 delivers the usual richness, with vast, deep fruit, mineral, oak and leesy flavors. It's as full bodied as a red wine, but a little heavy for a Chardonnay. Not an ager, it's best enjoyed now with the richest Chardonnay-friendly dishes.",90,48,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9863","US","Dark, big, bold and extracted, this Syrah has tough tannins that are threaded with intricate flavors of blackberry, licorice, pepper, cola and grilled bacon.

"9869","US","So good, so rich, so stunning, it's just a joy to drink even now in its youth. Defines the Heidi Barrett style of big, ripe, exuberant fruit and a classic structure, enhanced in this case by the firm tannins and fine acids of Atlas Peak. Explosive in blackberry and cherry pie filling and cassis flavors, with a distinct mineral tang that must come from the volcanic soils. Contains 2% Petit Verdot. Superbly enjoyable, but as a brand new wine, its future is only a guess. Drink now–2014?",97,250,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9870","US","This is a big Pinot Noir, dark and full bodied and juicy in pomegranates, cherries, red plums and sautéed wild mushrooms, and the interplay of oak with fruit even yields richer notes of milk chocolate. It's devastatingly good, but also too young and fresh now to show its best. With its fine tannins and exquisite balance, this articulate young wine should be best after 2013.",96,75,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"9875","US","Good fruit in this tannic mountain wine. Shows classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. But it's tough and hard, and also acidic. Doesn't have the balance for the long haul, so drink now–2012.",86,30,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"9878","US","Benessere's Sangiovese tests the limits of the variety's ability to thrive in Napa Valley, with good results year after year.

"9879","US","The Meyer Vineyard, in the Red Hills of Dundee, ripened especially well in 2006, bringing forth concentrated fruits that mix raspberry, cranberry, pie cherry and finishing hints of rhubarb. Spice and sharp acids add definition to the midpalate, and the careful barrel aging has introduced accent notes of nutmeg, licorice and black tea. Despite its heft and substantial 14.6% alcohol, this wine has a sleekness that carries it gracefully into a lengthy, elegant finish.",91,48,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"9880","US","This is a classy Chardonnay. Grown 1,200 feet above Calistoga and fairly well-oaked in new barrels, it's rich and complex, with flavors of grilled tropical fruits and toasted meringue.

"9881","US","Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah.

"9882","US","Structure, minerals and lees mark this elegant Chardonnay.

It's the architectural integrity that makes this wine so fine.",91,36,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9883","US","Although it is listed as 100% Riesling, the floral and citrus qualities of this wine seem as though some other grape—Viognier?—also has a role to play. It's lively and features a spiced-up nose that recalls a breath mint. The wine is off-dry, but sports plenty of acid, and the fruit flavors have a powerful sour lemon candy kick.",87,13,"Washington","Riesling",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9884","US","Soft, ripe and decadent, this Pinot, from the Napa side of Carneros, brims with blackberry, cherry, cola, vanilla, licorice and cinnamon spice flavors.

"9888","US","Notes of honeysuckle, white peach and fresh green herb are intensely aromatic. This off-dry effort balances zippy, lemon-lime acidity with layers of ripe, rich fruit.

"9889","US","Great price for a crisp, dry, clean Chardonnay that's so friendly with food.

"9892","US","A bit tart and disjointed now, and dominated by oak, with flavors of butterscotch, pineapples, green apples and cinnamon spice. But it's young. Give it time. Should knit together in early 2010.",87,32,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2

"9897","US","Pronounced Kay-lee, this is the most tannic of the Syrahs from Efeste-. Forward black fruit flavors are wreathed in smoke, and there is plenty of supporting acidity. This finishes with a burst of cherry.",90,38,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9898","US","Big, rich and fruity, with fantastically ripe cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors that are elevated by a note of sweet sandalwood, and brightened with crisp acidity.

"9899","US","A gorgeous wine, lush and refined from the first sniff to the last swallow. Rose petals, cotton candy, chocolate-covered cherries—it's a date in a bottle.

Silky and lightly spicy, with cinnamon, toast, mocha and tobacco highlights.",95,60,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"9900","US","An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals.

"9901","US","What a beautiful Cabernet. It's dry and classically elegant, with sweet, ripe tannins framing succulent blackberry, black cherry, violet, cedar and mineral flavors.

"9902","US","This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak. Packed with raspberries and cherries, the wine is completely dry and firm in minerals, and seems easily able to age for at least six years. Only 120 cases were produced.",94,100,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9903","US","The longer this wine breathes in the glass the better it gets. At first sip, it's obviously a very good wine, richly tannic and deeply impressive in blackberries, cassis and oak, with a firm minerality that grounds it.

"9906","US","Just delicious, this wine shows its pedigree from some of the best vineyards in the valley, including Merryvale's St. Helena estate.

Great for drinking now with the best meats and cheeses you can find.",93,65,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9907","US","Few Cabs on earth are riper than this, with its enormous flavors of black currants, cherry-pie filling, plum jam and chocolate that overwhelm the mouth with decadence.

"9909","US","Well made, this is a sappy, snappy take on Syrah, with vivid wild berry fruit and lively acids. It snaps into focus right away, then slowly softens as it weaves through the palate, with mixed berries, rhubarb, plum and hints of citrus. The finish lasts a full minute, adding notes of black pepper as it fades. This is beautifully rendered and not overblown in any way, with the alcohol at just 13.5%.",91,35,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9910","US","This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",91,30,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9911","US","So forward and appealing right now, it's hard to resist, but this could gain a little traction with a two or three years of age.

"9912","US","I like the elegance, but it seems like it was rushed to market. It will certainly benefit from cellaring, as it's young and rude in acids right now, and not showing well.

Should improve by the end of 2007, and hold for another five years.",91,53,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9913","US","Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir.

"9914","US","Despite its youth, this is a complete and satisfying wine. Woodward Canyon reds virtually always develop well in bottle, and so you can assume that this will continue to improve.

"9915","US","The wine, from a warm vintage, bursts with fruity charm, but this is a mountain Cab, and while acids are low, you'll find strong tannins.

"9929","US","Though Adelsheim offers a large assortment of single-vineyard Pinots, this is the first they've made from Zenith. It surely won't be the last. Concentrated, thick black raspberry and black cherry fruit centers a substantial wine, laced with vivid streaks of vanilla, tobacco and spice.

"9933","US","Run, don't walk, to find this amazingly priced Cabernet. It's so good and rich, it easily holds its own against Cabs costing five times as much. Dry and smooth in tannins, it offers a burst of blackberry, black cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors, with a wonderful coating of oak. Drink now–2013.",93,20,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9934","US","Dark and tannic, reflecting the vineyard's location in the cooler, foggier northwest, this Pinot Noir is dramatic in depth of flavor. With its core of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, cola and rhubarb, it's tight and rigid now, suggesting 5–6 years in the cellar.",93,75,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9935","US","Keller enters the big leagues with this marvelously layered Pinot Noir. For starters, it's delicious. Dry and crisp, the flavors are of ripe cherries, raspberries, tangerines, pomegranates and cola, with smoky, spicy complexities from new French oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, leading to a long, fruity finish. Best now and through 2010.",91,40,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9936","US","Not quite as opulent as the '04, but rich and softly appealing in blackberry, cherry, raspberry, mocha, lavender and peppery spice flavors. Drink now and through 2008 for its youthful fruitiness.",90,30,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9937","US","This is really solidly made and appealing wine, which nicely combines lush, chocolaty barrel flavors with penetrating Cabernet fruit. Cassis, cherry and sweet plum create a substantial fruit center, and it's swathed in a roasted coffee and mocha wrapping. Try it with a grilled steak, or better yet, a rich molé sauce.",90,25,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9938","US","A lovely Merlot, rich and fine, with lots of blackberry and cherry fruit, but also with more complex, earthier notes of olive tapenade, balsamic vinegar and sautéed wild mushrooms. The wine should hold for some years, but is really at its best now.",90,36,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9939","US","Big, juicy Pinot, dry and fruity, with layers of flavor that change with every sip. Black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, coffee, sweet tobacco, spice and oak all mingle in a myriad of sensations, finishing long and intense. Good now, but tannicly closed enough to warrant cellaring beyond 2007.",91,40,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9940","US","Pale in color and sharp in youthful acids, this Pinot needs time to show its stuff. It tastes good now, with rich cola, cherry, herb tea and cinnamon spice flavors, but the parts desperately need time to knit together. Best beyond 2007, for five years or so.",91,45,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9941","US","As is usually the case, Bernardus's regular Monterey Chard offers lots of bang for the buck.

"9942","US","These grapes come from a variety of vineyards scattered widely across the state, but they add up to a 98% pure Cabernet Sauvignon, intense, dark, plummy, rich and full-bodied. It's got all the grape's key component flavors on display: olive, light herb, and juicy purple fruits. The oak is still coming into focus, with strong notes of vanilla and clove. Give it a few hours breathing time.",90,18,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"9944","US","Still hard and tough in tannins, but that's Mount Veeder. Tastes like it was just bottled. Bigtime blackberry and cherry fruit is buried deep. Hold until 2008 and try again.",87,30,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9945","US","Classic BV Rutherford, with its thick, dusty tannins, black currant flavors, dryness and overall balance. Those tannins really hit in the finish, suggesting midterm aging. Good now, but should improve by the end of the decade.",87,25,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9946","US","Cool-climate Chard, with crisp, outspoken acidity and flinty flavors. A scour of fresh lime and mineral hits in the middle, leading to sweet oak on the aftertaste.",87,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9947","US","Showing plenty of Santa Lucia character in the well-ripened black cherry fruit flavors and sturdy structure, Paraiso's Pinot also displays an elegance that makes it immediately drinkable. It's dry, but there's an impression of sweetness from toasty oak and ripe fruit that's irresistibly tasty.",87,22,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9948","US","Has the most delectable fragrance of white peaches and vanilla. In the mouth, the peach flavors are joined by powerful kiwi and pineapple. For all the fruit, the wine is dry, crisp and balanced.",87,9,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9949","US","Here's a full-flavored Chardonnay in which toasty oak plays side by side with big, lush tropical fruit flavors to give plenty of mouth satisfaction. There's a vanilla custard and tapioca spice flavor on the finish that's especially rich.",87,19,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9950","US","This Merlot straddles that interesting line between easy, everyday drinking and real complexity. It's dry and richly tannic, and is the sort of wine that won't win a blind tasting, but leaves you reaching for a third glass with that steak.",87,16,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9951","US","Very clean, pure and elegant, this wine hails from one of the best vineyards in the appellation. It's savory in citrus, melon, figand spicy vanilla flavors, with a long, rich after-taste.",87,22,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9952","US","Toasty, herbal aromas; taut plum fruit on the palate takes on herb and coffee flavors, and tealike tannins that persist through the finish. Though this wine shows well, Winemaker Cara Morrison promises that the 2002 and 2003 vintages are even better.",86,19,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9953","US","Butter, pear and cinammon aromas preface tropical fruit on the palate. Feels round and medium-weight, with oak not so obvious until the finish. Even so, Winemaker Cara Morrison says that future vintages will show even less wood.",86,14,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9954","US","A real find. French in style, dry, rich and elegant. Hints of cherry and cassis are wrapped in thick, fine tannins, and the mouthfeel is sensual and velvety. Delicious now, but should hold through the decade. Grapes from Yorkville Highlands. The winemaker is the well-known Kerry Damsky.",92,36,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9955","US","Pretty tannic, a wine that makes the tongue stick to the palate, although it will soften and sweeten up with big, rich roasts. Underlying flavors are of blackberries, currants and tobacco, and the finish is very dry. Seems to have the density and concentration to cellar for the long haul.",91,80,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9956","US","There must have been severe vineyard selection for this wine, for it rises above the vintage to achieve real intensity and concentration. Cassis, blackcurrants and cherry flavors are enhanced with a touch of menthol and a lot of oak to produce a lavish, complex mouthfeel. The tannins are a work of art, lush and soft.",91,75,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9957","US","An extremely tannic and tough wine that numbs the palate despite polished plum, blackberry and dry chocolate flavors. Oak adds vanilla, smoke and a richly creamy texture. Will it age? The compact berry-cherry flavors suggest yes. Try again in 10 years.",91,80,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9958","US","A very fine Cabernet, the kind you like to think you'd instantly identify in a blind tasting as superior Napa. It has ripe flavors of cassis and blackcurrants, and fabulously rich, dry, complicated tannins that glide across the palate with velvety smoothness. Oak contributes the usual vanilla and smoke to this delectable kosher wine.",91,35,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9959","US","Laurel Glen's second wine, and no slouch. This vintage brings a richly textured, deeply flavored Cab as good as many costing far more. Ripe flavors of currants are wrapped in toasty oak, with firm but plush tannins. Will age through the decade and improve. A good value.",91,25,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9960","US","Heavy, with blackberry and blueberry jam and pepper flavors wrapped into strong tannins. It's a dry, well-ripened wine, but needs greater liveliness and complexity, especially at this price.",85,33,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9961","US","Soft and fruity, a mix of apples and peaches, with a hint of toasted cracker. A simple, light Sauv Blanc that is smooth and easy-drinking.",85,14,"Washington","Sauvignon Blanc",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9962","US","This is a clean, oaky and fairly simple Chardonnay. It satisfies the basic varietal requirements, with pineapple tart, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. From Testarossa.",85,30,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9963","US","Grassy and audaciously herbaceous, this is a fresh and high-acid Sauvignon Blanc, finishing with a blast of pepper. The blend includes 10% Sémillon.",88,13,"Washington","Sauvignon Blanc",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9964","US","This Merlot has a fair splash of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It does not shy away from underbrush accents of leaf and herb, adding complexity to the cherry fruit.",88,14,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9965","US","Good concentration, which gives the fruit more plum and black cherry than red raspberry. It's deep and sinuous, with threads of graphite and smoke, but the fruit is the star here, and the wine has the concentration and acidity to cellar well for a decade or more.",92,47,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"9966","US","A beautiful Cabernet, well structured, dry and rich. It feels soft and inviting in the mouth, with waves of ripe blackberries and cassis, and the fine tannins that accompany a good mountain red wine. Contains some Cabernet Franc, which adds cherry richness. Drink now for maximum freshness.",92,36,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9967","US","A lovely Cabernet. It comes from the winery's vineyard in the far southern part of the valley, not far from the Carneros line. The wine is medium-bodied, dry, silky and elegantly tannic, with complex cherry, currant, cola and cedar flavors. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",92,75,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9968","US","An upscale white wine made in the white Bordeaux style. It was partially aged in oak, on the lees, bringing a creamy, yeasty freshness to the citrus, tropical fruit and green grass flavors that are totally dry. Brisk acidity makes for a clean scour. A brilliant wine to drink with everything from goat cheese appetizers through firm fleshed fish like halibut to roast chicken.",92,45,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9969","US","This fancy, opulent Chardonnay is made in a certain Santa Rita style of high alcohol, which makes it enormously rich. It oozes pineapple, pear and lime jam fruit, while new oak adds buttered toast flavors and the glycerine from 15.5% alcohol makes the wine even creamier and sweeter. This is an inaugural vintage from the winery.",92,29,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9970","US","Young and vigorous now, marked by tannins and dryness that mask the fruit, making the wine somewhat aloof. However, the fruit is huge. It's ripe and succulent in blackberries and black cherries, and you'll find additional notes of smoked meat and black pepper for complexity. A wonderful Syrah that needs 3–5 years to blossom.",92,42,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9971","US","A fine bottle, fresh and fruity, with cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit in abundance. It's got depth and vitality, a youthful verve that promises fine ageability. Aged in 28% new French oak, it is just barely kissed with toast and mocha. A wonderful value.",92,26,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"9972","US","A tremendous wine, satisfying in youth, but this should also age for a while. Made with just 2% Merlot, it's impressive in young Cabernet blackberry and cassis flavors, liberally oaked and sweetly pure in the finish. The tannins are so soft, yet so refined. Should develop through the decade, but if you drink it now, give it a good decant.",92,60,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9973","US","This is a wine that offers lots of class at a very good price. It's marked by flavors of streamlined citrus fruit, Asian pear, honey and a hint of buttered toast. It finishes thoroughly dry. With nearly 37,000 cases produced, this should be relatively easy to find.",89,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9974","US","Made in the modern style of oaky creaminess and very flashy fruit, this Chardonnay erupts in a burst of oranges and rum punch, buttered toast and honey. It's rich and layered, if a little soft.",89,38,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9975","US","A dark and chewy Malbec, this displays a well-balanced mix of black fruits. Acids accent the wine like a wash of citrus. It's young and still pulling itself together, but the material and styling are excellent.",89,18,"Washington","Malbec",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9976","US","A chocolaty delight, this is a soft and smoky style of Merlot. The dark fruit flavors are accented with some toasted, slightly charred notes, and cinnamon spices. As very good as it is, the mouthfeel seems just a little broad as it flattens out the finish.",89,28,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9977","US","This wine has been variable, but the '03 shows lots of varietal distinction. It opens with a burst of white pepper-infused blackberry, chocolate, licorice and oak aromas, and turns rich and soft in the mouth, with similar flavors. The smooth tannins make this immediately drinkable.",90,42,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9978","US","Concentrated, beautifully defined flavors of pear, apple and ripe pineapple drive a stake through the heart of this wine, blazing a trail across the palate with tongue-thrashing acids and bracing minerality. As it slowly unwinds it reveals a finish of banana caramel tart, luscious and long.",90,23,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2
"9979","US","Here's Washington Syrah in the flesh, unadulterated, unblended, blasting out aromas of wild berries, spicy cranberry and rhubarb. It leads into a tart and peppery wine with whiffs of smoke and herb; young, wild and just slightly raw. A flavor parade for your mouth.",90,27,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9980","US","This is young, tangy, juicy and sweet, with ripe but quite tart fruit, showing plenty of acid and citrus rind. The toasty oak flavors are front and center, and delicious. All the Gamache red wines will benefit from additional bottle age, which will soften and meld the bacon fat, herb and sharp spice flavors. There is a lot of potential here for further development.",90,28,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9981","US","Pale, light-bodied, fruity and dry, this is the un-Cabernet, the red for white wine lovers. So easy to enjoy, you might overlook its complexities. Red cherries, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cinnamon and ginger candy, it's really delicious. Drink now for its freshness.",90,26,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9982","US","Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.",90,18,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2
"9983","US","This is bang-on clean and varietal Syrah, with a confident mix of sharp, toasty barrel flavors married to bright, acidic, berry-flavored fruit. Juicy and spicy, it's a great companion to the winery's Red Mountain Syrah, and shows the different character of the varied Washington terroir. It's just 14.2% alcohol, but it has a lot of power and kick to it.",90,30,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"9984","US","Fruit from moe than 20 vineyards went into this three-county blend. The result is a beautiful wine. Dry and spicy, it has lush pineapple, vanilla custard, tapioca, peaches and cream and gingerbread flavors, and a lush, creamy texture. Notable also for the crisp, brisk mouthfeel.",90,26,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"9985","US","Displays classic cool climate character in the stimulating acids and brisk tannins. Is it a cellarworthy wine? Probably not. There's blackberry and cherry fruit, but this dry, elegant wine isn't built for the long haul.",87,29,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9986","US","Pretty and polished, this Merlot has well-ripened cherry, cocoa and blackberry flavors, with a nice swoosh of wintergreen. It's dry, with decent acids, and is quite balanced. Will make a good, versatile food wine.",87,38,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9987","US","I like this wine for its voluptuousness, its creamy mouthfeel, and the long, pure flavors of cherries, chocolate and coffee. It's dry, elegant and completely balanced, the kind of Merlot people have in mind when they talk about “the soft Cabernet.”",87,18,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9988","US","Shows good intensity and focus, and while it's not very fruity, it displays a range of plum, leather, herb, cedar and earthy flavors. Tannic now, but doesn't seem like an ager.",87,25,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9989","US","The aroma's the best part now, alluringly rich and inviting in currants, oak and cocoa. But in the mouth, its way too tannic. The underlying black-cherry flavors are shut down. Balanced enough to improve, though. Try after 2007.",87,29,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9990","US","Largely Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a tough, young bruiser. It's very tannic now, but very fruity, with balancing acidity. Should purr along nicely for 10 years or so.",87,40,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9991","US","Well-oaked, this wine stars char, vanilla and woody flavors framing underlying cola and cherry flavors that, while dry, are rich enough to feel sweet on the palate. There's good acidity, and the texture is silky and smooth. Nice for immediate drinking.",87,50,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9992","US","Elegant and refined, but rather short, this is a wine for near-term consumption. It has earth, herb and cherry flavors and is dry in tannins. Drink while your big '01s are sleeping.",87,48,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9993","US","Quite dry and firm, without the sweet fruitiness that marks so many others. This one's citrusy and minty, but has deeper layers of cream that make it complex.",87,20,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9994","US","One of seven limited-production, single-vineyard Cabs this vintage by Beringer, a dense, concentrated mountain wine of considerable strength. The cassis, plum and herb flavors are just beginning to emerge from a tannic sleep, although the wine remains young and quite ageworthy.",91,80,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9995","US","This Châteauneuf-style wine is jammy, with black stone fruits, berries and dark chocolate, and a sweet black cherry core, but it has body and tannins to lend it weight. The winemaker suggests pairing it with cassoulet. New from Don Sebastiani & Sons.",90,5,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9996","US","A distinguished wine, from the opening scents of fine, toasted oak, vanilla and char through the ripe, classy blackcurrant and herb flavors. Tannins are rich, fine and supple. A very nice, upscale-tasting Cab.",90,60,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9997","US","This is an astonishing value, especially from such a prestigious appellation. Has a silky texture and lush but dry flavors of cherries, raspberries, herbs, mushrooms, coffee and clove that unfold across the palate. Versatile at the table; try with pork tenderloin with plum sauce. With more than 30,000 cases produced, this should be easy to find.",90,8,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9998","US","This 100% varietal is very ripe and jammy. The cassis flavors drink pure and intense and coat the palate through the long finish. There are underlying flavors of kirsch and mocha. A flamboyant, decadent wine, and a little sweet.",90,38,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"9999","US","Quite good for the vintage, a dense, concentrated wine with beautifully soft, complex tannins. Blackberry and cassis flavors drink dense and dry, with balanced acidity. Possesses that elusive but unmistakable quality of elegance and finesse. This is a big, flamboyant wine, but skillfully vinified; good acidity keeps things bright and crisp.",90,26,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10000","US","Maybe this wine needs some age, but right now it's strong in sweet jammy raspberries and cherries, and the oak sticks out, like a caramelized, sweet vanilla coat. Yet it has good acidity and a fine, silky structure. If only it finished drier and firmer.",85,36,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10001","US","You would be hard-pressed to guess the varietal in a blind tasting—it's generic red, almost 15% alcohol, cherry fruit, astringent tannins, some black olive and licorice. Quite drinkable but nondescript.",85,16,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"10003","US","Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off.

"10007","US","Intellectual, elusive and challenging, this wine makes you think. It's dry, silky and crisp in acidity, with complex mushroom, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. It's also a little rustic, but time could help. If you're a gambler, hold it until after 2015.",88,45,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10008","US","Lean and steely, with penetrating minerality, this bone-dry Riesling just begs to be paired with briny oysters or caviar. The palate boasts delicate apple and pear flavors that are layered with smoke, fresh fennel and a deliciously herbaceous finish.",88,25,"New York","Riesling",40.7127753,-74.0059728,3
"10009","US","A whiff of volatility brightens up the aromas of this ripe Merlot. The structure is tight and compact, and the acidity is substantial. Clean fruit flavors of red and black berries can be found, but this is a year in which all of the Fielding Hills wines would benefit from a bit more bottle age to knit together.",89,36,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10010","US","This is very rich and complicated, with oak and lees adding creamy, smoky notes to the ripe citrus, peach and pear flavors. It seems a little candied, in the California way, but it's clean and varietally proper.",89,26,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10011","US","A whiff of leather introduces a wine with a strong savory character; the leather and earth flavors start to bury the sweet berry fruit, and the tannins take on a chalky texture.",89,62,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10012","US","Shows the delicacy and finesse of the finest Pinot Noirs of this vintage, and is a solid expression of this always fine bottling, although lacking a shade of the opulence of the '04. With cola, cherry, licorice, pine, cinnamon and vanilla oak flavors, it's a complex, satisfying wine that will marry well with steak and grilled salmon.",90,52,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10013","US","This is thick and spicy, a raging bull of a wine that skates along the border of Napa Cabernet country. As this Horse Heaven Hills vineyard matures, it is becoming clear that it can deliver the big, broad and deep flavors that put Washington Merlot at the front of the class. What's especially nice about this blend is its intense bouquet of blackberry, spicy anise and cedar. For all of its power this retains its balance, its acidic spine and even a touch of grace.",90,24,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10014","US","Very fruity, in fact superfruity, this wine attacks with ripe pie-filling raspberries, red cherries, pomegranates, cola and vanilla-cocoa flavors that flood the mouth, lasting through a long, spicy finish. All that fruit is balanced with crisp acids, while a touch of dusty tannins adds to the fullness. Drink now.",89,45,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10015","US","Built for the cellar, this Cab is impressively deep in ripe currant, cherry, cocoa, milk chocolate and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a brittle astringency, and sweet in oak and fruit on the finish. Best after 2008, and for some years after.",89,60,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10016","US","Shows a welcome return to form for this bottling, after a few off years. The wine is wonderfully dry and complex, offering nuanced flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola, as well as the spicy, smoky sandalwood of oak barrel aging. A sophisticated and elegant wine for drinking now.",92,35,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10017","US","A dry, classy Merlot that will develop bottle complexity for a few years. There are beautiful tannins on this well-made wine; if you drink it now, decant to let it breathe, soften and allow the cherry, red currant, dried herb and oak flavors to emerge.",92,48,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10018","US","The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",92,48,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10019","US","This is a delicious wine. The blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, anise and pepper flavors have a pie filling richness, complete with the smoky-sweet pastry crust. Yet it's totally dry. Feels fine and distinguished, if a little hot in alcohol. Drink now–2012.",92,42,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10020","US","Made in a light-bodied, lower-alcohol style, this Pinot feels silky and gentle in the mouth. It really delivers when it comes to flavor. Displays big, impressive notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood that are complex and satisfying, and that finish entirely dry. Drink now and over the next four years.",92,44,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10021","US","The Laurène–Drouhin Family Estate Reserve brings a bit more earthiness to the table than the regular DDO bottling. In the mouth, the fruit—a delicate jumble of raspberry, pomegranate, cranberry and sour cherry—mingles with streaks of caramel, herb and leaf. A wine that will reward both cellaring (at least a decade) and studying.",91,65,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10022","US","The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit. Consistent in style with the winery's Fumé the Chardonnay has plenty of clean acid, great fruit, and a nice butterscotch finish in the back of the throat.",90,10,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2
"10023","US","The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",90,48,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10024","US","Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.",90,35,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10025","US","Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity. It's still a fairly restrained wine, rich in acidity and dry minerality, but rewards with pineapple custard and butterscotch flavors.",90,30,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10026","US","Same vineyards as the '04, but a riper, deeper, denser vintage. This is good Washington merlot, with muscle, extract and plenty of stuffing. Flavors run to the dark side, blue/black fruits, mineral, licorice, smoke. It's got the kind of mass that will stand up to all meats, and the balance to age over the next decade or so. Nicely built, still tight and chewy.",89,28,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10027","US","From the cool Green Valley, a wine that didn't get quite ripe this year. There are citrus flavors alongside bell pepper ones and the taste of various herbs. Plenty of oak and lees makes things more complex, but it's still a lean wine that demands foods to wake it up.",87,35,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10028","US","Very rich and fruity, stuffed with pear, peach and mango flavors that go on and on. Oak and yielding acids give this Chard a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.",87,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10029","US","After all these years, Mayacamas still marches to a different drummer. Not for them flamboyant fruit or a heavy plaster of oak. You won't find tropical fruits, scads of spices and vanilla. This wine is tight and earthy, and the dryness is not offset with glycerin or other pseudo-sugars. It's earthy and austere. The point is ageability, if you care to cellar it.",87,32,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10030","US","Light and lemony, with a zippy mineral core that leaves the palate bright and refreshed.",87,19,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10031","US","Another good value from this winery. The apple and peach flavors have something dusty about them, like dry, red California dirt on a hot summer day. Just a little oak spices up this dry and crisp wine.",87,16,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10032","US","Steely and firm on the palate, with a marked bend toward citrus and herb flavors. Bright and clean on the finish.",87,50,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10033","US","Sweet stuff, with flavors of butterscotch, vanilla and custard. The basic fruit flavors are peaches and pears. No problem getting the grapes superripe in this warm California region. Nice on its own as a sipper, or good with barbecued scallops in a rich butter sauce.",87,25,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10034","US","Soft, gentle and beguiling in its texture, this Cab has a silk-and-velvet mouthfeel. The flavors are very ripe, all cherries and blackberries and milk chocolate. In fact, the wine seems a little too soft for ageability, so drink up now.",87,75,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10035","US","Dark for a rosé, and full-bodied, this blush Syrah is long and strong in raspberry flavors that finish with a touch of vanilla and white pepper. It's a tasty sipper, nice and dry, almost as robust as Pinot Noir.",86,9,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10036","US","Classic coastal Sauvignon Blanc, ripe and forward in lemon and lime, honeydew, alfalfa, peppery cinnamon and vanilla flavors, with a great deal of acidity, although the finish is a little sweet. There's a lot going on here.",86,10,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10037","US","This tastes like it came from premium cool growing areas. It's crisp in acids, light-bodied and dry. The flavors are all on the surface, but totally delicious. They include raspberries, red cherries, cola, cocoa, vanilla, toast and Asian spices.",86,9,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10038","US","Shows some good black cherry and blackberry flavors, with an earthier, herbal and leathery side, and the tannins stand out. Should soften in a few years. Drink now through 2008.",86,65,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10039","US","Not the greatest Beringer PR of late, this wine showcases the weakness of the vintage. It's earthy and tannic, with only a suggestion of cherries and blackberries. It's a wine to drink now and over the next few years.",86,100,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10040","US","Gentle and smooth in tannic structure, with a subtle layer of polished oak, this wine nonetheless is a little light in fruit. Could use more concentration of its cherries and blackberries.",86,39,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10041","US","Shows well-ripened black cherry and cola fruit, with hints of Heirloom tomatoes and a dose of smoky oak. Dry and silky, but a little heavy in body.",86,22,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10042","US","Despite its silky mouthfeel, there's a toughness to this wine. It's extracted, with jammy stone-fruit flavors, and an earthy edge of coffee and dried herbs. Offers a robust contrast to Castle's regular '01 Pinot.",86,32,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10043","US","Broad, sturdy and herbal, this everyday Merlot is a fine choice for simple grilled fare. It's actually a rather interesting blend, with a mix of Cabernet Franc, Lemberger, Syrah and Sangiovese adding to the Merlot base.",85,10,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10044","US","Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.",85,42,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10045","US","Soft scents suggest berry pastry, and the color is already showing some early oxidation, confirmed by the rather mature flavor profile. This is ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, very soft tannins, and some sharp acidity at the very end.",85,28,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10046","US","A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",85,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10047","US","A sweet, flavorful Port-style dessert wine. Opens with enticing aromas of cassis, chocolate, caramel, vanilla and smoke. Rich and chocolatly in the mouth, with ripe flavors of currants that are backed up with bracing acidity. Delicious, with a long, sweet finish.",90,24,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10048","US","Rich and thoroughly enjoyable, brimming with blackcurrant and cassis flavors and a balanced overlay of smoky, spicy oak. This pretty wine drinks very dry and smooth, and the tannins are just right. It is elegant from start to finish. Drink now.",90,28,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10049","US","Another polished, succulent release from a vineyard that's not supposed to be warm enough to ripen Cabernet. Of course, the vintage was very good, and this effort shows upfront blackcurrant and leather flavors, with a long, fruity finish. It's generously oaked, and really excellent.",90,42,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10050","US","Made in a classic Napa style, with pronounced aromas of cassis and blackcurrant and a considerably layering of well-charred, toasty oak. Doesn't disappoint on the entry, and then it spreads currant and herb flavors all over the palate, wrapped in rich, fine, ripe tannins. Very good, but lacks that extra bit of intensity.",90,36,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10051","US","Quite a distinguished '99, with its flamboyant aromas of spicy blackcurrants and cassis, with an oaky overlay of smoke and vanilla. Feels good as soon as it hits the palate, with blackberry flavors that last through the finish. The jolt of dry tannins that makes the palate puckery suggests midterm aging.",90,38,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10052","US","Young, tight and primary, this stylish, astringent Cabernet includes 10% Merlot in the blend. Blueberry, cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors mingle in this tannic, ageworthy wine.",89,28,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10053","US","Young and bright, this is loaded with fresh boysenberry and tart cherry flavor. At first sip, it seems concentrated with excellent structure and length; as it breathes some green tannins begin to show in the finish. Overall a good effort.",89,25,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10054","US","This is a second wine from Palmaz. It's a big Cabernet, dry and full-bodied, with extravagant cassis, cherry and oak flavors that contain riper notes of red currants and licorice. Gets better as it sits in the glass and breathes, and could benefit from up to five years in the cellar.",89,35,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10055","US","This 50-50 blend from two well-established vineyards is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Young and stiff and still quite tannic, it shows compact cassis and blackberry fruit with an earthy underpinning, a hint of stem that adds some bite to the tannins. As time smoothes it and softens the tannins, more of the concentrated fruit should emerge; it's well-made and balanced; a fine example of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon done in a classic Bordeaux style.",89,40,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10056","US","There's a ton of dark, chocolaty toast atop the succulent fruit in this tasty Merlot. The spicy plum and black cherry flavors carry hints of sweet tobacco and chocolate cake. Though not a massive wine, its broad flavors are full and engaging.",89,25,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10057","US","Ten acres of Malbec was planted at Gamache in 2003; this is the first vintage to be released. It's off to a promising start, although the fruit thins out quickly. There are nicely managed tannins, earthy and herbal, tasting of green tea and displaying lovely aromatics. Scents of rose petals mingle with black tea, and in the mouth it is balanced and complex, with sweet blueberry and candy apple fruit, lightly dusted with cinnamon spice.",88,28,"Washington","Malbec",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10058","US","What's so nice about this Chardonnay is the way the dryness, acidity and minerality combine with tropical fruit to make for a splendid, Chablis-style California wine. It's a connoisseur's Chardonnay, requiring some understanding of structure. Don't drink it too cold; could even stand a brief decant at room temperature.",91,55,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10059","US","From a single block at Temperance Hill, this aromatic wine neatly captures the terroir without pushing too hard. There are herbal nuances. a hint of hazelnut, some earth and wet stone, all nicely blended into a wine that is robust but accessible. Good balance and well-managed tannins.",91,38,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10060","US","A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce.",91,38,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10061","US","This barrel selection of wines shows how well Sauvignon Blanc does in Happy Canyon. The variety was already a star in Santa Ynez Valley, but growing it in a warmer region adds ripeness and richness. It's lush in citrus and honeysuckle, with crisp acidity and oak barrel influences.",91,35,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10062","US","The 2004, like so many Walla Walla wines, was sourced from a different mix of vineyards. In this case the grapes came from Cold Creek, Canoe Ridge, DuBrul and Artz – a very fine group indeed. There's no slip in quality here, just a bit of added richness and darker fruits than in the previous vintage. Blackberry purée laced with coffee liqueur dominates this open, accessible, and thoroughly enjoyable wine. Nicely balanced and showing its youthful freshness in a clean and softly seductive style.",89,28,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10063","US","Opens with pleasant aromas of cherry and raspberry purée, cola, Asian spice, vanilla and toasted marshmallow, then turns opulently fruity and dry in the mouth. It's not light-bodied, though; shows a weight of tannic density that suggests serious pairings, such as lamb and steak.",89,35,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10064","US","This firm, tannic merlot is a step up in concentration from the winery's regular bottling. It's ripe, focused and still a bit tight, with stacked layers of berry, plum and cassis. Winemaker Rob Griffin retains some of the natural herbaceousness of the grape, as a background nuance, adding flavor interest. Decant it well before drinking.",89,25,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10065","US","A challenging wine, made all the more so because there's a beautiful entry and the wine has truly delicious aspects. It's softly complex and beguiling, with cherry custard, vanilla and smoky oak flavors, and shows real finesse. On the other hand, the short finish suggests it's not going anywhere, so drink up.",89,65,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10066","US","Here at last are the flavors that have been missing from Ste. Michelle Cabs for some time. This is crisply structured, varietally spot-on Cabernet. The ripe—but not jammy—fruit flavors of blackberry and black plum are amplified with spicy cinnamon from aging in American oak. There is a hint of chalkiness in the way the acids hit the palate, but otherwise this is picture-perfect, with well-delineated tannins and some delicious Asian spices on the finish.",89,17,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10067","US","Well, you can't expect Romanee-Conti for 10 bucks, but this is a pleasant, easy-drinking wine with enough Pinot Character to satisfy.  It's silky smooth, with some rasberry, beet and tomato notes, and dry, with a clean, spicy finish.",84,10,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10068","US","One of the drier Sangioveses of the year.  It comes down firmly on the lean side, and while there are suggestions of black-cherry fruit in the aroma, in the mouth it;s distinctly acidic, lean and sharp.  The struggle to interpret this variety in California continues, but this austere approach will not find favor with consumers.",84,14,"California","Sangiovese",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10069","US","Rich and intricate, a Chard that satisfies with its array of white peach, pineapple, mango, buttercream and spice flavors. Finishes with a slightly sweet, vanilla ice cream flavor.",86,14,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10070","US","Lots to like here, with a chocolaty, creamy smooth mouthfeel that carries rich, ripe flavors of black cherries and cocoa.",86,18,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10071","US","Northern Rhône-like, a big, dark and somewhat tannic wine, with grilled meat, pepper and blackberry flavors and a smooth finish. Not especially complex.",86,20,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10072","US","SuLei's Tanya Woodley ferments her Sauvignon Blanc in stainless steel, then ages it in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels. In this new vintage some residual sugar (just under 1%) remains, to soften the otherwise-searing acidity. It works well, crafting a fleshy wine loaded with citrus and honeydew. The finish lingers and has plenty of lift.",89,18,"Washington","Sauvignon Blanc",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10073","US","Exuberant aromas of white blossoms and ripe stonefruit settle substantially in the glass, revealing a rich yet layered palate that marries sweet cream and butter notes with lemon pith, smoke and striking acidity. Full and opulent, but elegant and balanced. Drink now.",89,24,"New York","Chardonnay",40.7127753,-74.0059728,2

"10075","US","A solid wine, rich in oak-inspired orange, apricot and Asian pear flavors, with a spicy, creamy finish. The acidity is notable, making this Chardonnay brisk and clean.",88,24,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10076","US","The cool vintage shows in the brisk acidity, hard tannins and herb and mineral flavors that accompany the usual blackberries and spices. There's plenty of elegance, with the wine showing a highly refined structure. Drink now–2014.",88,30,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10077","US","Lots of zesty Carneros acidity in this young Pinot that impresses for its silkiness and ripe fruit flavors.

"10078","US","With 20% Semillon, this is a very rich wine, partly barrel-fermented and aged on the lees. It's packed with ripe, fruity peaches, pineapples, green apples, melons, figs and dates. It's a little sweet, but zesty acidity comes to the rescue to provide balance and elegance.",88,25,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10079","US","Apex has just released this 2002, which makes it, as far as we know, the last of that vintage to see daylight. Dark and smoky, it is already heading into more mature, secondary fruit flavors, and has a pleasing softness throughout. Time has sanded away the rough edges of the tannins, and rounded out the herbal components as well. This is drinking very nicely, and gives you a cellared wine at a new wine price.",88,30,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10080","US","Better known for Cabernet Sauvignon, Charles Krug has a good track record for Merlot, too, and their '04 is quite a rich wine. Dry and balanced, it offers a wealth of black cherry, black currant and mocha flavors, and is soft and lingering on the finish.",88,22,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10081","US","This estate-grown Cabernet shows good concentration and a stylish mix of fruit, leaf and herb across the palate. There are subtle notes of tomato leaf, bark and earth, along with black currant and blackberry fruit. The tannins are smoky and substantial, with a green tea edge to them. The wine is finished at under 14% alcohol, and it captures the sort of varietal character that cannot be found in superripe, superhot New World wines.",88,22,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10082","US","Cabernet from Oakville for under $20? Yes, and it's a really good one. It's dry and full bodied and rich in classic blackberries and cassis.

"10084","US","Trisaetum is making some of the most exciting Rieslings in Oregon; now it can add Pinot Noir to its hit list. Estate grown, elegant and showing more than a little new French oak, this toasty wine drinks like a young Chambolle-Musigny. The tannins are sculpted and firm; the fruit ripe and racy with a mélange of red berries and currants. Give this more time in the bottle to absorb the new oak and shed some of the herbal aromas.",91,75,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10085","US","Awfully good, a wine that strikes you right off the bat as important and complex. It's dry and densely packed in blackberry and cherry pie filling, red currant, licorice and sweet, smoky oak flavors. Very good and rich, with complicated tannins, and soft enough to drink now, although it should age well.",91,175,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10086","US","La Fenetre scores with this lush, forward Pinot Noir that offers enough flavor to please almost anybody. It's enormously rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, roasted almond granola, vanilla cream, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that are so delicious, they're sweet, except that the wine finishes dry. Great with lamb. Drink now.",91,59,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10087","US","This is the reserve, a barrel selection limited to just 100 cases. The selection was done well and is meaningful; this has more grip and body than the excellent Estate 777 Pinot Noir that precedes it in price. A mix of Northwest berries define the fruit, set against moderately stiff tannins with suggestions of caramel from the oak aging. Put this one in the cellar.",91,60,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10088","US","This is yet another superripe, rich and luscious Chardonnay from Chateau Ste. Michelle. It's a tropical fruit-flavored California take on Washington terroir. Plush, smooth and plump, it nonetheless carries its weight well, with an especially fine, lingering finish.",89,17,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2
"10089","US","Dense, dry and young, this is a Syrah for the cellar. With 10% Petite Sirah, it has some fierce tannins, and is a little soft, but possesses the inherent balance to age. Give it two or three years, then enjoy the hearty cherry, cassis, leather, cocoa and balsamic flavors for a couple more years.",89,29,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10090","US","High in acidity and bone dry, this light-colored Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional right now, but I think it was released too early. It should gain momentum by the end of 2007, when the cherry, rhubarb and cola flavors become more integrated with the tannins and oak. If you have to drink it now, decant for several hours.",89,42,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10091","US","Here's a well-made wine that shows that this important producer can rise to the challenge when it retains its focus on varietal character. This authoritative, smoky wine smells like Syrah and it follows through with firm, supple, rich flavors. The floral and citrus notes, the herbal/olive underpinnings, the ripe—not roasted—fruit all hit the mark.",89,32,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10092","US","A very limited production wine from a new Walla Walla vineyard, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak and softened up with partial malo. It leans a bit more toward the citrus/pineapple flavor side than does the winery's regular Chardonnay bottling. This is a bit crisper, with subtle grassy highlights adding some lift and interest.",88,28,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2
"10093","US","Easy-drinking wine here, with lemon-custard flavors and textures.  Mothing complicated, and it finishes with a nice, spicy aftertaste.  At this price, it's a pretty good value.",84,12,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10094","US","Tart and lean, with a low flavor profile but pronounced acidity.  They must have picked the grapes very young.  You can taste the green lemony flavors.. while the wine scours and sears the palate.  If you like this style, the wine is a good buy.  If you want something fuller, stay away.",84,12,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10095","US","Pretty cherry flavors lead the way, framed in subtle herb notes.  But the tannins are rough, and the finish a bit short and tart.",82,22,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10096","US","This long-anticipated wine from a longtime grower-turned-vintner swings for the fences. Begins with fascinating, complex aromas—highlighted by lees, pineapple, cinnamon, smoke and white chocolate—and dazzles with its sheer opulence. Everything comes together in pinpointed harmony, right down to the mind-bogglingly beautiful finish.",96,35,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10097","US","This is a lovely, supple 100% Rutherford Cabernet, made in a controlled style.  It's stylish, with great flavors and class.  The oak is plush.  Balance and harmony characterize it all the way, from the brilliant aromas to the clean, thoroughbred aftertaste.",94,55,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10098","US","Fruity, crisp and slightly sweet, with pear, citrus, fig and spearmint flavors, this easy sipper will go well with a variety of foods.",85,24,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10099","US","The attractive aromas of cherries, leather and smoky oak seem weirdly disconnected from the palate, which is quite hard in tannins and light in flavor. There's a suggestion of cherry and blackberry fruit. Drink now.",85,50,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10100","US","Green olives dominate the aroma of this streamlined wine. It's elegant rather than exuberant, with sturdy tannins, and finishes very dry. Best now.",85,25,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10101","US","A clean, correct California Chardonnay, reliable as ever. Pear, peach and citrus flavors go down easily, buffered by graham crackery spice.",85,12,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10102","US","Refreshing in acids and citrus zest, this wine finishes semi-sweet with flavors of spearmint, fig and melon. It's a nice cocktail wine, or try one to with a honey-baked ham.",85,16,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10103","US","Lovely mouthfeel to this wine, with rich, soft but intricate tannins, and lots of ripe blackberry and cherry fruit. It is a little too sweet, though.",85,32,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10104","US","Here's a pretty Pinot that captures the balanced terroir of Anderson Valley. It's not a big, ageworthy wine, more of a village-type, but elegant and savory in cherry, cola and spice flavors. The crispness makes it an exceptionally food-friendly red wine.",88,30,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10105","US","This is the oldest of the Milbrandt vineyards, planted in 1997. Though a bit riper than the Evergreen vineyard bottling, this Chardonnay feels lighter, with less density. It's balanced and complete, and the flavors of green apple and Asian pear offer a fine rendition of well-ripened Washington fruit.",88,20,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2
"10106","US","This is Paraiso's most expensive Pinot, a block selection from their estate vineyard in the southern part of the Highlands. The wine is very good, although for some reason not quite up there with the 2001 or 2003. The fruity ripeness shows in the forward cherry, raspberry and cola-root beer flavors, and and wine is fully dry. Drink now.",88,40,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10107","US","A delightful Riesling, sweetly aromatic, and balanced with some residual sugar. It has well-crafted flavors of pear and vanilla.",88,15,"California","Riesling",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10108","US","Enormously jammy in raspberries and cherries, this is almost sweet, like spicy dessert-pastry filling. There's good acidity and even a bite of grippy tannins, but the wine is so powerful it lacks subtlety.",88,75,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10109","US","This is a big, fruity effort, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, dates and spicy toast. Brisk Central Coast acidity brings a tart, cranberry bite to the richness. Drink now.",88,40,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10110","US","Apricot jam and late-harvest botrytis flavors are often characteristic of this vineyard. This is bone dry, with brisk acidity and stony minerality. It will gradually lose fruit over the years.",88,45,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10111","US","Once again, the Burgundian touch of Veronique Drouhin has crafted a wine of surpassing elegance and immaculate structure. This is the antithesis of a jammy, California style yet it retains much of the vibrancy of New World fruit rather than the suppressed rusticity of Burgundy. Delicate cherry and tart plum fruit is sculpted into a wine with nuanced details of cola and coffee and spice.",91,45,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10112","US","California Syrah doesn't get much richer than this. It explodes in blackberry and cherry jam, olive tapenade, dark chocolate and bacon flavors, wrapped into firm, intricate tannins. Lacks some vital acidity for balance, and so it doesn't seem ageable, but a fancy wine for drinking now.",91,56,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10113","US","Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",90,23,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10114","US","This rich Syrah is a pleasure to drink with lamb and beef dishes. It has an excellent structure, softly tannic and silky in the mouth, with long, luscious black cherry, blueberry, beef teriyaki, sandalwood and spice flavors. Only 100 cases were produced.",90,35,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10115","US","The star of the show among the three Libra wines tasted, this biodynamically-farmed offering is dark and exotic, with a range of scents from cherry liqueur to cinnamon, anise, and flowers. It breathes open into a perfumed and spicy wine, with accents of orange peel around substantial, brambly fruit.",90,35,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10116","US","Roughly 140,000 cases were produced, making this (along with the Two Vines) the benchmark budget Merlot for the state, if not the country. These wines are given plenty of cellaring, which helps to soften them up. The style is wide open and flavorful, with broad cherry and berry fruit set against very smooth, chocolatey tannins. The Grand Estates has thicker, more substantial weight and a silky, milk chocolatey finish.",88,11,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10117","US","Ripe, with tons of juicy cherry, blackberry, mocha and woody spice flavors, but fully dry. There's good acids and tannins, so it's all balanced and harmonious. It's not an ager, but is lovely and fairly complex.",88,35,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10118","US","This is an excellent vintage in Washington, and Bob Bertheau has made a soft, smooth, well-crafted Sauvignon Blanc. Just a bit more than one-third was barrel fermented, and the blend is 100% varietal. It's a fruity, polished effort with citrusy highlights, but I'd love to see the winemaker veer a bit more towards a Washington State-style that includes some sweet grassiness in the finish.",88,15,"Washington","Sauvignon Blanc",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10119","US","This wine fits the winery style like a comfy old shoe. It feels good, smells good and wears well. There is a nod to the grassy quality of the grape, but it's smoothed over with toasty cracker flavors and thicker seams of fig, melon and pear.",88,14,"Washington","Sauvignon Blanc",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10120","US","This has a little barrel fermentation, lending a creaminess. But it has the same fizziness of a young white just months out of the fermenter. It's also delicious.",88,15,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10121","US","Shows restraint in the reined-in cherry and herb flavors and modest oak, but it's not a simple wine. It has layers of interest that drink dry and balanced.",85,16,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10122","US","Cola, cherry, mocha and vanilla flavors, in a light-bodied, silky wine, with pronounced acidity. Finishes dry. A bit rustic, but offers good Pinot character.",85,24,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10123","US","Good value in a dry Pinot with real Salinas quality. Delicately structured and elegantly crisp, with silky tannins and cherry, cola and herb flavors.",85,12,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10124","US","Well-made, and dry, with good tannins and berry-oak balance. Has a rustic quality that makes it an everyday sort of quaffer.",85,40,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10125","US","There's a ton of winemaker bells and whistles here, notably oak and lees, but they can't overcome the wine's lean earthiness. The result is unbalanced, although not unpleasurable.",85,30,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10126","US","Good fruit and oak on this black currant-scented Cab, but the tannins are rough and numbing, even at five-plus years. Doesn't seem likely to soften before the fruit falls out, so drink up.",85,31,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10127","US","Feels rich in the mouth, with ripely sweet tannins and lots of cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavor, as well as pronounced oak. It's too soft and sugary to age, so drink up now",85,25,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10128","US","A medium-weight Chard with mainstream attributes: toasty oak, ripe pears and a plump, custardy mouthfeel. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic warmth.",85,26,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10129","US","There's a reason why Syrah is on a roll in America, and it's wines like this that make the case. Soft and juicy, it's a mellow, sensual wine, with a taffeta mouthfeel that carries rich flavors of cherry-pie filling, red licorice and vanilla oak that are delicious and worthy of a second glass.",87,16,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10130","US","This spicy Bordeaux blend has barrel flavors of cinnamon toast, coffee and caramel that run rampant over the fruit. Raspberry and cherry candy flavors hit you mid-palate, and with a little more time in bottle this has every chance of turning out to be a much smoother and more polished wine than it is currently showing.",87,30,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10131","US","Lots of new French oak barrel fermentation and lees stirring went into the making of this wine, and it shows the yeasty richness and creamy texture of that expensive handling. Yet the underlying wine is just very good. It has very bright acidity, with slightly sweet flavors of spearmint chewing gum, lemons and limes.",87,28,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10132","US","Try sneaking this into your next wine group blind tasting. It might turn some heads. It shows the ripe, polished cherry, plum, sage, carob and licorice flavors of the finest Merlots, with rich, finely ground tannins, and finishes dry. With a drop of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, it has true complexity.",87,15,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10133","US","Among the four different single- vineyard selections tasted, this showed best. Strawberry/cherry fruit is spiced up with dark chocolate and a thread of pine sap. Long and layered, this offering shows enough vineyard character to make a designate compelling.",90,40,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10134","US","This is a smooth customer, with a rich, silky mouthfeel, and has the soft seductive velvety character that allows it to feel complete as a standalone clone. It stops a bit short in the finish, hitting some herbal tannins, but resonates with pretty barrel notes of caramel and a hint of honey.",90,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10135","US","Made in a lighter style, this Pinot comes from the cooler Napa side of the Carneros. It's light- to medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture and pleasant flavors of cherries, exotic dusty spices and sandalwood. Elegant and moderate in alcohol, it's a wine to drink now.",90,24,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10136","US","A vigorous wine. In its youth it's bright and jammy in raspberries, cherries and currants, with fine, silky tannins and citrusy acidity, like a squeeze of lime. There's oak here, too. A bit disjointed now. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar to knit together.",90,46,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10137","US","Firm and slightly chewy, this interesting wine brings brambly berries, dried herbs, forest floor and light mushroom flavors together in a well-crafted, well-balanced effort. The alcohol is just over 13%, and the style is classic Oregon.",90,35,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10138","US","This is a delightful, off-dry style with the clean, natural, bracing acidity to perfectly balance out the 2.3% residual sugar. About 3% Muscat was blended in, adding a pretty orange note to a fruit-laden mix of melon, citrus and cotton candy.",88,11,"Washington","Riesling",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10139","US","A light-golden Chardonnay that does its county proud. It's lively and bright, with medium weight and flavors of sweet lemon custard, apple, and a lime-zest-dominated finish. This is a very good wine at a very fair price that should pair with an assortment of dinner fare.",88,11,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10140","US","Juicy, tart and tightly wound, this pure Malbec has a core of wild, brambly berry and light plum. Nicely managed oak aging (28% new) brings in a lick of smoky caramel, clove and coffee. The flavors fall off a little too quickly on the finish.",88,22,"Washington","Malbec",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10141","US","This shows a strong Bourbon barrel flavor from the new oak that is still being integrated into the fruit. Tart wild-berry flavors surfacewith air, but the impression is of a high-acid, sharply-defined Merlot; it's structured for aging.",88,35,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10142","US","Delicious in its own way, with a soft, gentle mouthfeel framing upfront flavors of raspberry, cherry, vanilla, toast and pie spice. Drink now with a steak or a lamb chop.",88,60,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10143","US","Chardonnay is the sweet spot in the white wine lineup (along with Riesling, of course). Big, bright and buttery, with plenty of legit oak highlights—none of this fake vanilla or microwave popcorn excess. Bacon fat, smoke and toast match the big, round, rich fruit.",88,11,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2
"10144","US","Scents of smoke, earth, citrus rind and a strong acidic foundation define this wine. It's a fine example of cooler-site Washington Syrah, with all the nuances that that brings to the wine. The alcohol hits 14.5%, but doesn't overwhelm the lighter side of the wine. It's genteel and stylish.",88,25,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10145","US","The addition of 5% Grenache and 4% Viognier—roughly the same as last year's excellent wine—enhances this fruity, forward, well-built Syrah. It's a light, open and attractive style; fragrant, varietal and effusively fruity. Don't look for power or mass here; it's all up front. This is quite delicious.",88,20,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10146","US","Opens with a super-leathery, funky note that could be brett or a clonal attribute. Once past the odor, it's dry, soft and herbal-plummy.",84,18,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10147","US","Seems a bit tired, with the fruit flavors turning to herbs, dried leaves and mushroom. Finishes dry and clean, with some green-apple notes.",84,25,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10148","US","Simple, tart and very dry, with modest cherry and cola flavors that finish with a scour of gritty tannins. Might soften and improve in 3 years.",84,20,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10149","US","Heavy, soft and tannic, this wine shows black cherry, blackberry flavors and coffee, and is very dry. The cherry finish is attractive, though.",84,25,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10150","US","Here's a wine that went wrong somewhere. It's dark, dry and full-bodied, but is unexpectedly earthy and green in the mouth, and while it has smooth tannins, it's not going anywhere.",84,30,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10151","US","Dry and smooth, and a bit coarse, this wine shows berry, oak and leather flavors. Short finish.",84,37,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10152","US","Delicious in raspberries, cherries, sassafras, cola, orange blossom tea and vanilla, with a beautifully silky texture, this single-vineyard Pinot comes from low-yielding vines in the central part of the appellation. It's a little too soft for cellaring, but offers solid pleasure now.",87,50,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10153","US","Soft and gentle in the mouth, with a silky texture, this very ripe Cab shows jammy blackberry, cherry, vanilla and smoke flavors. This is the best Lake county Cab from Guenoc in years.",87,18,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10154","US","A Merlot with real elegance. This is fully dry, with firm, furry tannins, showing black cherry and currant flavors that are transforming into dried fruits and sweet leather. Could develop for a few more years.",87,22,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10155","US","Although this isn't one of Arista's single-vineyard bottlings, it's right up there with them, offering rich flavors and a lovely structure. It's dry and silky, with brisk acidity backing raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors, and an earthy hint of balsam-splashed beefsteak tomato. Drink now–2013.",90,42,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10156","US","Marked by big, sharp acidity, like biting into a lime, and clean, linear flavors of limes, green apples and pineapples, this bone-dry Chardonnay badly needs food to balance it out. Think of bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, or a spicy Ahi tuna tartare dish.",90,35,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10157","US","Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crème brûlée. Elegant and impressive for drinking now.",90,27,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10158","US","This Pinot is pure California in its ripe fruitiness. It's explosive in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with sandalwood and dusty spice notes, and also displays crisp, cool-climate acidity. A delicious wine to drink now.",90,38,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10159","US","This is enormously rich in berry, cherry and cola flavor. It's flashy, but not particularly subtle as a Pinot Noir should be, and it veers on being a little heavy.",88,70,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10160","US","Light and tight fruit flavors of pretty berry open slowly after plenty of breathing time. The wine is nicely structured, balanced with the addition of 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Malbec—the only drawback is the almost complete lack of aroma. Even with extended airing, the fruit comes up but the nose stays closed, giving the impression of a shortened finish.",88,28,"Washington","Sangiovese",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10161","US","This limited-production (2,000 cases) reserve is a fitting companion to Covey's amazingly good every day Syrah. It's very clean, well-balanced and solidly varietal. The bacon fat barrel flavors are welcome accents, as are the hints of citrus peel and smoke. Tart berry fruit and polished, lightly herbal tannins flesh it out.",88,13,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10162","US","Soft and creamy, this is consistent with the previous vintage and sets the stage for the winery's bigger, oakier single-vineyard Chardonnays. Mixed stone fruits, pineapple and an elegant, full-bodied mouthfeel make this particularly appealing for the price. It uses the oak judiciously, and avoids the overdone vanilla flavors that many inexpensive New World Chardonnays rely on.",88,13,"Washington","Chardonnay",47.7510741,-120.7401385,2

"10165","US","The sources of this Syrah are all very good, including top vineyards from Santa Barbara, Arroyo Seco, Alexander Valley and Lake County.

"10166","US","Alderbrook is one of those insider wineries that does a good job at a fair price. This crisp, dry Chard is an elegant example of the long hangtime '05 vintage, with spicy tropical fruit, butterscotch and vanilla cream flavors.",87,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2

"10170","US","A little sharp, but easily the winery's best non-vineyard designated Cab since the '02. Shows a ripeness level that slam dunks cherries, blackberries, cola and oak onto the palate, yet maintains an elegant dryness.",87,18,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10171","US","A blend of Minnick and Ash Hollow grapes, this is a punchy, high-toned take on Syrah. Particularly attractive are the bright raspberry flavors, peppered with, well, pepper! It's got the kind of verve that you find in a simple Grenache, and finishes light and tangy.",86,32,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"10173","US","This single-vineyard wine from Foxen's estate is a little too sweet. It seems to contain residual sugar, to judge by the jellied pineapple and apricot flavors.

"10174","US","In 2004 new winemaker William Ammons began at Glen Fiona, and this is the first of his wines to be released. This is spicy with pepper and herb, both in the nose and in the mouth. The fruit is quite tart and tastes of rhubarb and cranberry.",86,30,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10175","US","This single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon captures the flavor profile of Pepper Bridge fruit, with streaks of green olive and green tea adding complexity to the tart and brambly fruits.

"10177","US","Hello alcohol and black cherry liqueur. A nicely made and compelling Syrah this is, although the alcohol is intense.

"10180","US","Very big and rich and extracted, offering massive flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with caramelized oak. Very delicious, if a little obvious.

"10181","US","A real success in a challenging vintage, this is a meaty, flavorful, well-built Pinot Noir. The fruit is a mix of berries, especially strawberry, with accents of peach, cola, earth, sassafras and cinnamon. The wine keeps on going; it doesn't wimp out or turn bitter. It's interesting now, but should develop even more flavor with some years of cellaring.",90,40,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10182","US","This limited-production offering pays tribute to Bill Fuller, founder of Tualatin Vineyards and one of the pioneers of Oregon's modern era wine industry.

"10183","US","Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling.",90,22,"Oregon","Chardonnay",43.8041334,-120.5542012,2
"10184","US","Good blackberry, cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors in this rich, dry wine, but it's also tight in tannins and brisk in acidity. Too hard and unsupple for drinking now. Give it 4–5 years to change in the bottle.",90,56,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10185","US","This is a pretty nice wine. It's made in a lighter style than from warmer regions, and is silky, absolutely dry and crisp in acids.

"10186","US","This is a blend of grapes from Calistoga to Carneros. The wine shows Cabernet's full-bodied character and rather fierce tannins, although it has an enormous soul of blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, as well as plenty of new oak. Shuttered and hard now, it should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",90,43,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10187","US","Softly gentle, this wine is easy to like for its wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, blueberries and milk chocolate.

"10188","US","Nice and smooth, this Cab hits the palate with a plush tannic structure and oak-infused cassis and red cherry flavors. It's dry and elegant right now, but not an ager, because it's a bit thin and short in the finish.",87,40,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10189","US","Bone dry, firm in tannins and tartly acidic, this wine feels hard in the mouth. It shows flavors of cherries and cola, with a leathery finish. Elegant in structure, it may soften and sweeten over the next five years.",87,35,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10190","US","Shows rich, racy acidity in a dry wine whose flavors veer toward ripe pineapple-tart filling, cinnamon spice and butterscotch, wrapped in a creamy texture. Would score far higher if the fruit were more concentrated.",87,20,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10191","US","This is a solid example of straight-ahead Washington merlot. The fruit is pretty and polished, bright with raspberry and cherry flavors, forward but with the palate presence to age for some years.

"10193","US","Maryhill, frustrating as many of their wines may be, does well by their Cabernets. This is not in the same class as the exceptional 2003, but offers ripe red fruits highlighted with smooth tannins and traces of black tea wrapped around black cherry and blackberry fruit. Ultimately, it falls into the same soft sweet red category as the winery's other wines, but with a bit more definition, snap and style.",87,30,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"10199","US","There's a good streak of acidity behind this dry wine, which is fortunate because the tannins are very soft. It has just enough crispness to balance the ripe cherry and sweet green herb flavors. Similar to Sangiovese, this is a pleasant sipper now.",86,24,"California","Tempranillo",36.778261,-119.4179324,1
"10200","US","A solid, middle-of-the-road Syrah, with a gently tannic structure framing blackberry, cherry and blueberry jam, mocha, fig, leather, dried herb and spice flavors.",86,20,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10203","US","This delicious wine, made entirely from Cab Sauvignon grapes, displays clear varietal character and balance. The tart cherry fruit has been ripened appropriately, retaining some desirable herb and forest floor character. Further oak aging adds a bit more complexity.

"10206","US","2010 was a tough vintage in the Columbia Gorge, so the sources for this rare Washington Pinot appear to have changed.

"10211","US","Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples.

"10212","US","From the heart of Pinot Noir country, this iconic vineyard, originally planted in the 1970s, yields concentrated flavors of black cherry, root beer, incense and peppermint.

"10224","US","This has a moderately strong streak of funk, barnyard, leather, whatever you want to call it, wrapped around sweet boysenberry fruit.

"10235","US","This is a very good Cab to drink now for its firm, dry mouthfeel and ripe flavors of cherries, currants and cedar. It feels elegant and distinguished.

Fruity and forward, it shows black cherry and cola flavors, with a light streak of licorice.",87,29,"Washington","Malbec",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10252","US","There are lot's of cherry, cola, sandalwood and exotic spice flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with a nice crispness from the acidity.",87,17,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10253","US","The first of Morgan's 2010 Pinots to be released, it shows promise for the winery's single-vineyard bottlings. Dry and firm in acidity and tannins, it's a big, strong wine, packed with cherry pie flavor.",87,32,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10254","US","This is arguably the winery's best Merlot ever. While it is not an ager, it is a lovely food wine that's dry, with crisp acidity. It expresses subtle flavors of cherry, red currant, tobacco and sandalwood flavors.",87,20,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10255","US","Fresh tropical fruit, peach and apricot flavors star in this flashy young wine. Oak also plays a prominent role, giving buttered toast and caramel notes. And the texture is creamy and smooth. The overall impression is very rich and powerful, but the wine could have more finesse. Drink now.",89,75,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10256","US","Just four barrels were made, with grapes from a one-acre estate block of Pommard clone Pinot Noir planted more than 30 years ago. Detailed and brambly, with strawberry and cherry fruit, mottled with baking spices and chocolate. The finish carries some brown sugar flavors, a hint that perhaps this wine will age rather quickly and should be consumed over the next couple of years.",89,35,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10257","US","Lincourt's grapes are so rich and well grown that they don't even need oak to make a delicious Chardonnay. The wine is dry and crisp, with appealing flavors of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The savory creaminess seems to come from aging on the lees. What a great food wine.",89,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10258","US","Always one of the finest values in Oregon Riesling, the Kings Ridge really shines in 2009. Juicy and bursting with ripe pineapple, pear and peach fruit, this big, round, luscious wine masks its residual sugar with tangy acidity.",89,12,"Oregon","Riesling",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10259","US","A little too ripe and raisiny, but not a bad Merlot, with a plush, velvety texture. There's good plum, black currant and smoky oak flavor, and the wine is dry and balanced. Drink now.",86,35,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10260","US","Very dry, high in acidity and with a minty edge to the cherries and blackberries, this wine tastes young and raspingly tart right now. It's elegant enough in structure, but wants opulence. Hard to tell if it will go anywhere.",86,35,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10261","US","Not up there with the winery's Reserve or Rancho Santa Rosa bottlings, but a good, respectable exemplar of terroir. Dry, crisply acidic and balanced, it shows cherry, cola, herb, sweet vanilla and spice flavors wrapped into a silky texture.",86,26,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10262","US","Shows the clear, fine color, silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity that characterize a fine, cool-climate Pinot Noir, but I wish the fruit were a little more concentrated. It's fine in cola, red cherry, pomegranate and rhubarb, but the middle is thin and the finish is quick. Drink now.",86,50,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10263","US","A sensational Cab that exhibits power and opulence in the ripe blackcurrant, cherry, cocoa and new oak flavors, yet is subtlely balanced and harmonious. Showcases preternaturally gorgeous tannins, soft and sweet. The more you sip, the greater the impression.",95,70,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10264","US","Intensity is the name of the game here. Intensity of fruit, of oak, of creamy lees, of spices, of finish. The lush tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast flavors explode in the mouth, leading to a long and rich finish.",93,40,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10265","US","Imagery's wines, across the board, keep getting better and better, and this single-vineyard Cab is the latest example. It's dry and complex, with cassis and blackcurrant flavors that are seasoned with toasty oak. Finishes balanced and elegant.",92,35,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10266","US","This is just now being released, unblended Yakima Valley Syrah, with tight, almost impenetrably hard red fruits. It's a little too volatile, with lifted scents that include touches of nail polish, and the tannins are tough and chewy. It's a wine that should be decanted for several hours if you want it to show its best.",85,30,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10267","US","Jekel has long experience with Cabs from Arroyo Seco, a cool region better known for whites. This Bordeaux blend shows the region's classic dryness and acidity, and flavors of blackberries and currants.",85,15,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10268","US","Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper.",85,16,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10269","US","A little soft and candied in its oaky pineapple, applesauce and buttered-popcorn flavors, but easy to drink. Chardonnay admirers will recognize a distinctively Californian interpretation of the variety.",85,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10270","US","This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?",85,30,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10271","US","This five-vineyard blend of Chard has superripe, possibly botrytised, flavors of apricots and new oak. It's almost late-harvest in style, although it's fully dry. A disappointment.",84,32,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10272","US","Pretty good for a ten buck red, this has proper varietal flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak, and is fullbodied and tannic. There's a rustic edge, but it will do fine with roast chicken or even macaroni and cheese.",84,10,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10273","US","Lightly floral and quite Burgundian aromatically, this wine exudes a mixture of caramel and earth amid a full-bodied texture and racy acidity.",87,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10274","US","A bit rugged, with some unripeness, but otherwise a solid Cabernet, drily tannic and clean. The blackberry jam and oak flavors are pleasant.",87,40,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10275","US","This shows that apricotty, botrytised aroma and flavor often found in Santa Lucia Chardonnays from the cooler parts of the appellation, but it's not at all sweet. Instead, it's a bone-dry wine, with vibrant acidity.",87,40,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10276","US","Strives for power in every way, with massively ripe, extracted pineapple, orange and peach flavors, as well as lots of oak. The barrel aging brings butterscotch and caramel notes.",87,45,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10277","US","Medium weight, round and tangy, this shows a core of cranberry/cherry fruit, a whiff of cola and a suggestion of the tack room. It's a detailed and somewhat earthy Pinot Noir. From the estate vineyard, it's what you hope to find in Oregon— Pinot that is artisanal, a little quirky, distinctive and above all, enjoyable. Fades just a bit too quickly.",89,35,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10278","US","This rich, ripe Merlot offers lots of smooth flavor. Grown on the Sonoma side of Carneros, the wine is dry and soft in tannins, marked by black cherry, blueberry, toast and vanilla flavors.",89,35,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10279","US","Compiled from a half dozen vineyards scattered throughout the northern Willamette Valley. Firm, sculpted and dense, this has more grip and depth than might be expected at this price point. Each vineyard's grapes were separately fermented; the blending has pulled them all together with dark, plummy flavors, notes of raisin, baking spices and caramel, and a smooth, penetrating finish.",89,25,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10280","US","Dark purple red with a great fruity nose full of blackberry, tart cherry and dark plum, this tiny-production out of Livermore Valley is medium bodied with deep concentration and a nice finish cradled in cardamom and earthy bacon.",89,24,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10282","US","Slightly soapy and pungent, the aromas do not immediately suggest Sauvignon Blanc fruit. There's a pine resin undertone, but once in the mouth the wine asserts itself and tastes of ripe citrus and fresh herb. It's fairly soft and lush for Sauv Blanc.",86,15,"Washington","Sauvignon Blanc",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10283","US","This is one of the winery's ripest, softest current Pinot releases. It's dry, but a bit heavy in mouthfeel, with a slightly stewed quality to the cherry and berry flavors. It also has some dry, astringent tannins in the finish. Could evolve over the next five years, but the overall quality is not likely to improve.",86,42,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10285","US","Herbal and tannic, this won't be mistaken for a cult Cab, but in its price range it offers authentic Cabernet flavors. The fruit is lean and the tannins slightly green, and the herbal side of the grape is much in evidence. But everything is in balance, and it avoids the watery soda pop flavors of most cheap Cabs.",85,9,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10286","US","Baby Poux is what, you ask? The name of a particular block of grapes in the Champoux (pronounced shampoo) vineyard in Washington's Horse Heaven Hills, just now coming into maturity. Nice cherry and red currant fruit is matched to gorgeous new oak, with flavors of toast and graham cracker, butter cookie and caramel. This is a wine to put in the cellar and enjoy in 10-15 years.",92,42,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10287","US","Otis includes the oldest cabernet vines in Washington state, dating back to the 1950s, and has been a Columbia vineyard-designate since 1981. Black pepper and dried sage are its imprints, and Otis always makes a tight, ageworthy wine, not in the currently fashionable ultraripe mode. Lean and herbal, but deep and ageworthy.",91,23,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10288","US","A fruit-driven Pinot Noir that still manages to evoke so many of the undergrowth, damp leaf aromas associated with this elusive grape variety. It has elegance, subtlety, mineral flavors and spicy, smoky, toasty wood. From vines that were first planted in 1982, this is a wine that should evolve well over five to 10 years.",91,46,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10289","US","Like the winery's syrah, this young wine shows a lot of spicy new oak at the moment, although the specs say only 30% of the barrels were new. There's a full, flavorful mid-palate of cherry and plum, nicely framed against toast, smoke and char. Plenty of power and punch for a pure merlot.",91,25,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10290","US","Dense, deep and delicious. Among a fine group of CC reserves, this gets my vote for the best of all. Inky, tannic yet beautifully, classically varietal. Really dense, it delivers concentrated boysenberry and black fruit flavors, and the co-fermentation with viognier adds aromatic orange peel/citrus rind notes. Lively, perfumed and complex.",91,30,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10291","US","This dry, country-style Cab has some sharp, green tannins that bring astringency to the blackberry, cherry and cola flavors. Will go fine with a cheeseburger.",84,18,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10293","US","This Syrah was grown in Carneros in the cool, long '05 vintage, which may explain its minty sharpness, despite the low case production level. You'll find enough cherry fruit and new French oak to make it fairly rich, but that sharp green tang remains.",84,22,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10294","US","The grapes come from the cooler Oak Knoll area of Napa Valley, yet this wine is very soft and melted, without much acidity to provoke and enliven the ripe cherry, vanilla and sassafras flavors. It does show Pinot's silkiness, and is easy to drink.",84,20,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10295","US","Shows opulent, vibrant flavors of pineapple and orange jam, with accents of butter, cream and vanilla. Very flashy and decadent, if a little obvious. This should pair nicely with rich shellfish dishes.",87,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10296","US","Hard and showing an herbal edge, this single-vineyard Merlot will require some further bottle age and/or decanting. It drinks more like a Cabernet than a Merlot, with a green slant to the tannins.",87,28,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10297","US","Tastes plummy, jammy and spicy, with lots of wood tannins and a long finish. It's a good Pinot Noir that will pair well with steak.",87,30,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10298","US","A bit coarse in the mouth, especially compared to a smooth Napa Valley Cabernet. It's bone dry and moderate in alcohol, with tannins putting a bite on the sweet blackberry fruit.",87,50,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10299","US","Sweet oak and jammy fruit dominate this Chardonnay. Made in the popular style, its buttered toast, orange marmalade and honey flavors—all brightened with acidity—will find widespread appeal.",87,16,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10300","US","A portion of this is estate grown, the rest sourced from neighboring southern Oregon vineyards. Harvested at just 24 brix, it's an elegant style, with plenty of tart wild berry flavors, and alcohol under 14%. Just a bare hint of new oak adds a nice toasty note to a black cherry finish.",88,20,"Oregon","Tempranillo",43.8041334,-120.5542012,1
"10301","US","Big, rich and heavy as usual, a full-bodied Pinot Noir with thick tannins and jammy cherry, berry, currant and oak flavors. Rather clumsy now, this heroic Pinot Noir might do interesting things over the years.",88,48,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10302","US","Cranberry fruit, with pungent clove accents, sets up this spicy, assertive Pinot Noir. What appear to be strong barrel flavors include vanilla and caramel along with coffee and clove. The fruit is tart and smooth, but the barrel flavors are not yet entirely integrated.",88,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10303","US","The reserve Merlot lacks the smooth, buttery softness of the regular bottling, substituting stiffer tannins, deeper color and a definite herbal component. Perhaps the thinking is that this will age longer, but for sheer pleasure it does not measure up to its less expensive sibling.",85,28,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10304","US","White Oak's Syrahs have been O.K. over the years—clean, dry wines that have some charm. What they lack is richness, as evidenced again by this '03. At four years of age, its tannins stick out because the cherry-berry fruit is too thin to balance them, giving it an astringent feel.",85,25,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10305","US","This is already quite soft, oxidized and mature. It's a pleasant take on Sangiovese, absolutely ready to drink and approachable with warm, raisiny fruit flavors. There's a soft, chocolaty landing that keeps the tannins easy also. But there's not much character and no real stuffing here.",85,15,"Washington","Sangiovese",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10306","US","This is a solid effort in a very difficult vintage. A freeze took out a lot of Washington grapevines in 2004, and it probably impacted the quality of the fruit available for this budget blend. The 2004 carries far more of the green bean and herbal qualities than recent vintages, but the tannins are softened and for the price it seems honest and well-made.",85,8,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10307","US","Lots of ripe boysenberry, cranberry and sour cherry fruit to start, with a strong foundation of tar, espresso and bitter chocolate. This could pass for a Super Tuscan in a blind tasting. It unfolds slowly, with an interesting herbal/olive edge to it, and will reward additional cellaring.",91,23,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10308","US","Winemaker Trey Busch gets more confident and assured with each new vintage, and this is his best cab yet. It's 100% cabernet sauvignon, from the Lewis, Seven Hills and Spoffard Station vineyards. Light scents suggest cherry tobacco, and cherries are the main theme here, ripened to 14.7% alcohol, but balanced, firm and packed with fruit. The blend was done right after fermentation, which gives it a head start at this young age, and the tannins and oak are beautifully managed.",90,32,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10309","US","Exceptionally ripe in black cherries, blackberries, cassis, and chocolate, and sweet in fruit juice essence, although it's technically dry. Polished and smooth, with a nice edge of acids and tannins for grip. Almost too flamboyant in sweet opulence. Anything more in this direction will be excessive.",90,80,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10311","US","Beresan owner Tom Waliser manages several Walla Walla vineyards, including Pepper Bridge, from which this fruit was sourced.

"10313","US","There's too much oak for too little fruit in this wine, with the result that it tastes of sappy, smoky toothpicks. Buried under all that wood are modest apricot and pineapple flavors.",83,30,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10314","US","The problem with this wine is it's too sweet and hot. It goes beyond rich, ripe fruit into frankly jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries and vanilla, with a Porty finish. The alcohol is 15.4%.",83,30,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10319","US","So sweet in fruit, it's almost like a dessert pastry. Shows blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, with pie spices and caramelized oak. Finishes a little sweet, but it's clean and made in a popular style.",87,24,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10321","US","The aromas indicate a mix of ripe and less ripe fruit—some fig and date scents, some herb and bark scents.

"10322","US","Made in a very ripe, very oaky manner, this Chardonnay is extraordinarily rich now, if not very subtle. It's all about power.

"10323","US","One of the better California Sangioveses out there. It has a delicately silky texture and is very dry, with the acidity the variety always packs behind the cherry flavors.

"10324","US","Stomp! is a second label for Dusted Valley, with colorful graphics and a bit of ‘tude (“Don't worry, we keep our gnarly, fungus ridden toes away from the grapes” reads the back label.)

"10327","US","The first impression of this wine is that it is still very young. The fruit is full of primary tastes, raspberries and redcurrants.

"10331","US","Basically dry but a little raisined, this has apricot jam and lemon candy flavors. Although the new oak is modest, it seems to dominate, with a woody, toothpicky heaviness.",83,13,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10332","US","The 2004 vintage was a rough ride in Washington, and Ste. Michelle generously shared a lot of fruit from their vineyards that escaped the freeze. One senses that Snoqualmie drew the short straw, as these 2004 reserve wines are well below the quality that this outstanding value producer has shown in the past. This is not reserve quality by any stretch of the imagination; it's light, watery and vegetal.",83,23,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"10334","US","If you like your white wines with a white sugary finish, this is for you. Tastes like apricot, pineapple, peach and apple jelly.",82,16,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10335","US","Thin and raw, and slightly sweet, this is not a very satisfying Cab. It tastes like candied blackberry and cherry LifeSavers.",82,28,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10336","US","Dark, full-bodied and dry, this Syrah is a bit rustic, with some sharp acidity accompanying the blackberry fruit and pepper. Doesn't show a great deal of complexity, but it's a solid red wine for drinking now with hearty meats or stews.",87,40,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10337","US","Tight black fruit and hints of stem and wood suggest that this herbal Cabernet needs more time in bottle. The tannins are slightly green, and the softening influence of buttery barrel aging has not yet been fully integrated.",87,28,"Washington","Cabernet Sauvignon",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10338","US","This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.",87,12,"New York","Chardonnay",40.7127753,-74.0059728,2
"10339","US","A good, brisk Chardonnay, dry and honest. Not flashy or dramatic, it pulls its punches, with a deft touch of minerals, peaches and vanilla.",87,25,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10340","US","Lots of classic varietal character in this Cabernet. It's very dry and rich in blackberries, cassis and herbs, with a kiss of smoky oak. The tannins are a bit sticky now. Give it 2–3 years in the cellar.",88,40,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10341","US","This northern vineyard location delivers more herb and pine needle character than warm fruits, but you'll find elegantly defined cranberry and sour cherry mingling with leaf and cinnamon. It's not exactly delicate, but it is crafted for nuance more than power.",88,45,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10342","US","A side project from    Panther Creek's winemaker, Libra's affordably priced Willamette Valley Pinot Noir is dark, aromatic and surprisingly concentrated. Blackberries and black cherry fruit, with a splash of cola, continues into a midpalate plush with pepper, moist earth and a hint of nectarine. It's front loaded, full-bodied and drinking well right now.",88,20,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10343","US","Tart cranberry fruit, mixed with wild strawberries and some woodsy, leafy notes, anchor this multivineyard blend. Firm and spicy, it's well balanced and medium weight, and should continue to improve for several years a cellar for up to a decade.",88,30,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10344","US","With its mint-accented cherry and blackberry flavors and raw tannins, this is a rustic sort of Merlot. It has the sharp, edgy mouthfeel of a country-style wine, but it's clean and fruity, and will do fine with anything that calls for a dry, full-bodied red.",84,9,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10345","US","Soft and sharp, this rustic wine has simple cherry, blackberry, leather, coffee and wintergreen mint flavors. It finishes with a touch of sweetened coffee. Might get better after a year or so in the bottle.",84,36,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10346","US","Dry, acidic and direct, this warm climate Sangiovese appeals for its cherry flavors and dusty tannins. It really needs rich, oily meats and cheeses to open up and show its sweet core of fruit.",84,16,"California","Sangiovese",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10347","US","This is barrel fermented, with noticeable flavors of heavily buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Bright with crisp acidity, it also features notes of ripe pineapple, pear, peach and mango.",87,15,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10348","US","Fragrant apple blossom and vanilla custard notes are delightful on this luxurious and balanced Chardonnay. Sweet butter and cream notes on the midpalate add weight, but are offset by brisk acidity and a spray of saline on the finish.",87,15,"New York","Chardonnay",40.7127753,-74.0059728,2
"10349","US","This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.",87,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10350","US","The mix of fruits here is unusual, with flavors of citrus, stone fruit and berry all in play. A pure Malbec, with lots of acid and a tightly wound middle, it should smooth out a bit with more time in bottle.",87,28,"Washington","Malbec",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10351","US","A fine Chardonnay, brisk in acidity and dry, with complex citrus, peach and pear flavors, enhanced with smoky oak. Drink now before it loses its freshness.",87,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10352","US","A funky undertone, similar to the Nicholas Estate bottling, weaves through the wine, along with a mix of cranberry, raspberry and sour cherry fruit. Despite the 14% alcohol, this wine seems light, delicate, the flavors pleasing but pale, and the finish a gentle fade.",88,40,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10353","US","Nice and ripely sweet in fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this Syrah is made for drinking now. It's dry and rich in tannins, with a soft, velvety mouthfeel. Shows interesting complications of smoked meats, pepper, cola and minerals.",88,54,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10354","US","A little rugged in tannins, but nicely dry and crisp in acidity, with rich, forward cherry, boysenberry, cranberry and cola flavors, accented with a hint of toasty oak. An easy, elegant wine to drink now.",88,19,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10355","US","Bright, fruity and spicy, this palate-lifting effort brings flavors of pineapple, pink grapefruit and melon. Lightly spicy, balanced and showing a little toast around the edges.",88,18,"Oregon","Chardonnay",43.8041334,-120.5542012,2
"10356","US","Very rich, ripe, oaky and delicious. Dazzles with waves of buttercream, buttered toast, buttered popcorn and butter-drizzled bananas, with plenty of underlying pineapple fruit and honey. Could be more subtle, though. It's all on the surface.",88,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10357","US","Of the winery's current crop of five Syrahs, this is the next most expensive, but it's hard to tell why. Possibly because most of the grapes come from Napa Valley, they paid more for fruit. But that means nothing. The wine is tannic and has a glyceriney sweetness to the blackberry and cherry fruit that's almost syrupy. Doesn't seem like an ager.",84,40,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10358","US","This has a lean, stalky green character. Yes, there are cherries and plenty of oak, but that minty acidic thing dominates.",84,60,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10359","US","Buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramelly-vanilla flavors dominate this wine. Fortunately, a strong punch of pineapple and orange jam stands up to all that barrel influence.",87,28,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2

"10362","US","A really nice, classically structured Cabernet that can stand beside bottles costing far more. The blackberry and cherry flavors have a touch of sweet oak. With savory acidity, it's good to go now. Production was 13,500 cases.",88,20,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10363","US","A nice Cabernet at a good enough price to drink on a regular basis with a upscale meal. It's dry and elegant, with blackberry, black cherry and currant flavors, elaborated with smoky oak. Shows real charm.",88,18,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10364","US","Tangy and pleasantly round upon entry, this mingles fresh apple and peach fruit with baking spice highlights. There is a full midpalate, fruit-driven and flavorful, that gracefully tails off into a tart and juicy finish.",88,20,"Oregon","Chardonnay",43.8041334,-120.5542012,2
"10365","US","A difficult wine made problematic by the vintage. The cherry fruit tastes overtly sweet, and I suspect there's some residual sugar, the tradeoff for keeping alcohol moderate. Most unfortunate, because everything else works.",83,45,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10366","US","Thin, dry and acidic, this shows modest peach and citrus flavors. It's a good wine, and elegantly structured, but really should have greater fruity intensity for this price.",83,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10367","US","Strong and aggressive, this dark and almost syrupy Syrah crosses the line from high-toned to volatile. The California-style, grapey fruit flavors of plum and blueberry should warrant a higher score, but for some tasters the volatility will be too much.",86,25,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10368","US","The reserve seems to have spent more time in barrel, bearing a chocolatey finish, but otherwise it is quite similar to the Marryhill's regular Sangiovese. Slightly higher alcohol makes for a bit more concentration of the strawberry fruit, but the herbal, peppery bite is still there in the finish.",86,20,"Washington","Sangiovese",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10369","US","Scents of fresh lemons, herbs and white flowers grace this delicately structured, unoaked Chardonnay. Brisk and tonic on the palate, it's a breezy white that's perfect for summer sipping.",86,15,"Virginia","Chardonnay",37.4315734,-78.6568942,2
"10370","US","This is a dry, acidic, tannic and earthy Syrah. It has impressively deep flavors of black and red cherries, bacon and sandalwood, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Not an ager, but give it a few hours in a nice decanter.",87,36,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10371","US","Fragrant and soft, this wine carries a gentle floral fragrance—crushed roses—into a midpalate of bright raspberry and cherry. It turns a little leathery in the mouth, astringent but with the cherry flavors persisting, suggesting that further bottle age will soften it and add more textural complexity.",87,40,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10372","US","On the sharp, bitter side, and despite a heavy coat of sweet toast, it struggles. The cherry flavors finish dry.",82,9,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10373","US","Sweet and soft, this simple Chardonnay has flavors of oranges, pineapples, vanilla, cream and buttered toast. It's made in a style to appeal.",86,29,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10374","US","Hard and tannic at first, this young wine grudgingly reveals a core of very tart cherry fruit, encased in flavors of stem and wood. A coffee-infused finish does not conceal the chewy, tough tannins.",86,24,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10375","US","Something like a cross between a silky Pinot Noir and a soft Merlot, this is a gentle, fruity wine, with berry, tobacco, cola and spice flavors. A nice scour of tannins suggests this will pair with rich, oily meats and cheeses.",86,16,"California","Sangiovese",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10376","US","Rich as can be, but oak dominates, giving the wine buttered toast and caramelized vanilla flavors, and you'll even find notes of buttered popcorn. Although there's lovely pineapple and citron fruit and fine Carneros acidity, this Chardonnay tastes overly manipulated.",87,55,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10377","US","Packs plenty of punch into an inexpensive, everyday Chardonnay. With brisk, tangy acidity, it offers rich, appealing flavors of pineapples, green apples, vanilla and sweet, creamy butter.",87,11,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10378","US","Very good juice, but as with many of the seemingly endless single-vineyard Pinots from Erath, you can't help but wonder what might happen if some real blending took place? Cranberry and raspberry fruit, young and sharp, has not yet integrated to chocolaty barrel flavors. It's a wine split down the middle, with a chalky finish.",87,47,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10379","US","Sourced from the excellent Lewis Vineyard, this toasty, chewy Syrah displays black cherry fruit against a strong background of vanilla. At first it seems tart to the point of being almost sour, but as it breathes, the oak mutes some of the acid and balances it out.",86,25,"Washington","Syrah",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10380","US","This has orange, pineapple and green apple flavors that are accented by oaky caramel. Balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity, this should pair well with rich shellfish fare. Drink now.",86,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10381","US","This Yakima Valley Merlot is forward and light, with a dried leaf character complementing the fruit flavors of melon and strawberry. A peppery note strikes home in the finish, with just a hint of Band-Aid.",86,22,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3
"10382","US","This is a dry, minerally and acidic Chardonnay, with just enough of a squeeze of lemon and lime to satisfy. Drink this austere wine with roast chicken, broiled halibut and vegetable tempura.",86,30,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10383","US","Tannic and dry, this has cherry-berry flavors that finish with a touch of tobacco and spice. Ready to drink now.",86,34,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10384","US","Wonderfully smooth in the mouth, all satin and velvet, and so dry and crisp, it makes your mouth water. Good flavors, too, suggesting freshly picked wild blackberries, anise and black pepper. There's just a trace of some unripe fruit, however, that turns vegetal. Drink now.",87,70,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10385","US","Made in a dry, lean style, this Chard has plenty of elegance. It has citrus, pear and mineral flavors, with a touch of oak and bright, brisk, coastal acidity.",87,20,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10386","US","Sobon's Syrah is from one of the winery's oldest plantings, one that is organically farmed and lightly cropped. The resulting wine, which includes small percentages of Zinfandel (6%), the winery's specialty, as well as Petite Sirah (2%) and Grenache (2%), is more on the savory meat and cooked plums end of the Syrah spectrum, with a silky texture. The wine falls a tad flat on the finish.",87,14,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10387","US","Flavors of creamy vanilla pudding, buttered toast and pineapple jam mark this slightly sweet Chardonnay. A crisp streak of acidity provides much needed balance to the richness.",86,13,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10388","US","There is lots of charm in this soft, gentle Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but it offers some nice cherry, Dr. Pepper and spice flavors.",86,20,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10389","US","There is a lot of sweet, upfront blackberry and cherry fruit in this Cabernet. A good wine that should pair well with everyday fare.",85,25,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10390","US","Few wineries produce an Oakville Chardonnay. This is a soft and heavy effort, with apricot and tangerine flavors.",85,45,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10391","US","Good, strong citrus fruit, wildflower and honey flavors in this wine, and powerful acidity too, like a squirt of lime juice. Some barrel influence shows up in creamy vanilla. Would be nice now as a cocktail sipper.",87,15,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10392","US","There is a lot going on in this affordable Cabernet. It shows real character in the dryness, firm tannins and classic flavors of blackberries and cedar, with a tug of herbs. A full-bodied red wine, and a great restaurant pour.",87,14,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10393","US","Tons of blackberry, black cherry and cassis flavors in this dry, tannic wine. It's somewhat direct now, like fruit jam tarted up with citrusy acidity. Could age well, but it's a close call to predict.",87,70,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10394","US","Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay for those who like these strong, direct hits. It's powerful in tropical fruit, citrus, pear and green apple flavors, with a creamy overlay of buttery oak. Drink now.",87,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10395","US","This excellent Dundee Hills vineyard supports a well-made, rather delicate wine, reflective of the lighter 2007 vintage. Strawberry fruit and tea-flavored tannins combine in a balanced, lightly tart, fairly simple Pinot Noir.",87,40,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3

"10400","US","Another new entry into the under-$20   Oregon Pinot ranks, this one from Wilson Daniels. Oregon law requires that wines with varietal labeling be 95% the named varietal; here there is 3% Syrah in the cuvée. Tart red berries, leaf and herb mingle in a graceful, though light bottle. A nice balance of fruit, herb, acid and tannin, with a pleasing spicy finish.",87,19,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10401","US","Tight and unyielding, with a dominating Band-Aid streak that does not disappear even after many hours of breathing time. There is some Walla Walla Syrah berry and loam character evident, and the vineyards are first rate (Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge), but the reductive, plastic flavor masks much of the fruit.",87,32,"Oregon","Syrah",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10402","US","A good, dry mountain Pinot. It's a little tough, with some uneven tannins and a bite of acidity, but rich in cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Might improve a little after 2 or 3 years in the bottle.",87,48,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10403","US","Oak overpowers this wine, dominating with buttered toast and caramel flavors. Underneath is pineapple and peach fruit and zesty acidity.

"10404","US","Lots of people will like this wine, but it is a little hot in high alcohol and excessively soft. The jammy blackberry and cherry have a baked, raisiny edge. Definitely made in a warm, ripe California style. Drink now.",87,48,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10405","US","A big, lush Chardonnay from the Wente family's Ernest Wente Vineyard, this is barrel fermented and aged on lees for a long 18 months in new American and French oak.

"10406","US","With alcohol at just 11.5% and a flowery new label, this is a complete makeover from the 2008 A to Z Riesling. The fruit is back, along with lemon and orange peel, honey and tea.

"10407","US","If you like that bite of gooseberry and dry, green grass and hay flavors, this is for you. It's dry and tart in acidity, made richer with citrus fruit, white flower and vanilla. Would be great with goat cheese.",87,18,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10408","US","Much like its Willamette Valley stablemate, this is a dark, aromatic Pinot Noir, with fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry. It's solid and a bit blocky, but full in the mouth, and there is an unusual set of spices—clove and jalapeño pepper to be exact. An interesting bottle, a bit off the beaten track.",87,25,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10409","US","Superfruity and jammy, with massive raspberry, cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, accented with black pepper. The texture is soft and voluptuous.

"10416","US","Unabashedly tropical on the nose and palate with gobs of ripe mango, guava and peach, this cheerful Chardonnay is fresh and juicy, with lemon-lime acidity and a surprisingly-elegant minerality on the finish. Drink now.",85,16,"Massachusetts","Chardonnay",42.4072107,-71.3824374,2
"10417","US","A single-clone selection from this vineyard; it's like a pencil drawing, a sketch for a complete wine. Sharp edges, tight lines, a quick burst of pomegranate, earthy tannins and it stops, a hard finish.",87,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10418","US","A good effort at this price, this tart and tasty Pinot mixes cranberry and sour cherry fruit with plenty of juicy acidity. Ten percent was aged in new French oak, and you can pick up just a lick of chocolate as the finish fades.",87,15,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10419","US","This Cabernet is as soft as velvet, with a clean bite of acidity, and the cherry and blackberry jam flavors are evenly paired with smoky, sweet oak. Drink now, and easy to find, with 30,000 cases produced.",87,19,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10420","US","A little obvious in its appeal to our liking for oak and ripe fruit. Who can criticize the pineapples, citrons, tangerines and green apples, with their overlay of caramel and buttered toast? Rich as it is, you find yourself wishing it were more subtle and nuanced. Drink now.",87,39,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10421","US","Sweet and soft, with cherry pie, date and toffee flavors dominating. You could almost drink it as a dessert wine.",85,38,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10422","US","Soft and lightly fruity, this has an underlying chalkiness. That chalky sensation runs across the palate and seems to mute the other flavors, such as herb, which are on the light side.",85,17,"Washington","Merlot",47.7510741,-120.7401385,3

"10426","US","This has lots of tropical and apricot flavors, with oak and creamy lees notes. It's simple and a bit sweet, but should appeal to consumers.",84,25,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10427","US","Sweet and simple, with flavors of buttered toast, popcorn, white sugar and pineapple jam. Crisp acidity helps for balance. It's not really a dry table wine, but it's a good example of its style.",84,20,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2

"10431","US","A splash of tart cherry introduces this charming Pinot Noir, which resemble a country wine from the nether reaches of Burgundy. The alcohol does not touch 13%, yet the flavors are here, with tart berries, a bit of stem, sharp tannins, and a medium-long finish. A great quaffer.",86,18,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3

"10435","US","Bright gold in color, this is fragrant of sweet spice, smoke and orange rind. Medium-bodied in style, the palate is a tad tart, with notes of sour apple, lemon and underripe tangerine. Finishes on a sour wood note.",84,25,"Massachusetts","Chardonnay",42.4072107,-71.3824374,2

"10438","US","Don't be confused by the name; this is a blend of fruit from three different sites, united by their “green” farming practices—hence the name and the green label, that sets it apart from the rest of the Panther Creek lineup. Earthy and infused with composted, organic flavors, this herbal, leafy Pinot Noir comes across as a little rough and tumble, but interesting.",86,35,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10439","US","The scent carries light suggestions of cured meat, along with tangy berries. Sharp-edged and tight, this needs decanting to fill out the finish.",86,38,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3

"10444","US","This wine is ripe in raspberry and cherry flavors, but it feels heavy. The sweetness and lack of structure make it taste like wine candy.",82,13,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10445","US","Round and fruity, this mixes berries and hints of tropical fruit. Acids are just enough, and there is little or no trace of a new barrel. Quaffable and light.",86,18,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10446","US","Sharp, herbal and varietal, with a deep rose color. Strawberry and Bing cherry fruit shines here, but the tannins take over in the finish. Some further bottle age may help to smooth it out.",86,25,"Oregon","Cabernet Sauvignon",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10447","US","Very tart and acidic, this shows cranberry fruit flavors and the barest suggestion of cured meat. Fruit-powered, sharp and quite young, this might substitute for a cru Beaujolais more than something from Spain.",86,24,"Oregon","Tempranillo",43.8041334,-120.5542012,1
"10448","US","With pleasantly dry blackberry, blueberry and herb flavors as well as a kiss of oak, this is an eminently drinkable Cabernet. At this price, it's an affordable quaffer for parties.",86,8,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10449","US","Still young and tart, with sharp acids, this Pinot shows cranberry and raspberry fruit, a coating of milk chocolate, and a finish that is an uneasy mix of acid, stem and earthy tannins. Nothing has settled into a seamless whole; it's a collection of parts that needs more bottle time.",86,28,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3

"10453","US","The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.",97,625,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10454","US","A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.",96,135,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10455","US","A brilliant Chardonnay, displaying both the terroir of this fine upland part of Monterey County, and the cool vintage that let the grapes hang on the vines until they were perfectly ripe. Dazzles with pineapple and mango fruit, with a perfect jacket of sweet, vanilla-scented oak. Best of all is the acidity, which is brisk, bright and clean.",95,45,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10456","US","A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting.",95,170,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10457","US","Ripe and oaky in the modern style, with strong apricot, tangerine, pineapple and peach flavors and a buttery, creamy texture. Offers lots of upfront Chardonnay character.",86,17,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10458","US","This dry Riesling has a steely spine running right through the heart of the wine; you can almost taste the metal. It defines and confines the flavors; the fruit seems like an afterthought. That said, it might just be the perfect wine to try with fresh oysters, firm and lightly lemony with a hint of brine.",86,12,"Oregon","Riesling",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10459","US","This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there. Yet it shows a fine structure and relatively modest alcohol, a feature of the 2008 vintage. Good as it is now, you can safely cellar it for the rest of this decade and watch it evolve.",95,85,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10460","US","So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure. Blackberry marmalade, cassis and cocoa flavors are balanced despite hefty alcohol. An extraordinarily delicious wine, but it's meant to be enjoyed in its youth. Drink up by 2016.",94,100,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10461","US","A marvelous vintage for Freedom Hill, this high-acid Pinot is loaded with black cherry fruit. Rich, ripe, full, tart and penetrating, it might seem one-dimensional at first, but it has such excellent focus and depth that the fruit simply rocks. The finish weaves in threads of smoke and mocha, but this is a wine to cellar for a couple more years at least.",94,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10462","US","A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate. All indications are that this is an ageworthy wine. Should begin to throw sediment and mellow in seven or eight years, and could go the distance to 2020 and beyond.",94,150,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10463","US","Extraordinarily ripe and sweet in blackberries, cassis and figs, with a lovely perfume of violets and cedar, this soft, lush Cabernet, which was blended with some Petit Verdot, is so decadent now, you can hardly resist it. But it's pretty tannic, with good acidity, and has the structure to ride out the next eight years.",94,95,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10464","US","Along with the Freedom Hill bottling, the Savoya is the wine of the vintage for Ken Wright. A beautifully-crafted mix of brambly berry, thistle and herb, this textural and detailed effort keeps developing added complexity as it rolls across the palate. Blackberry, black cherry, and hints of truffle infuse the complex, deliciously satisfying finish.",94,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10465","US","Immaculately clean and fresh, this enters the mouth with a pleasing lightness, displaying a mix of stone fruits and a streak of vanilla wafer running right through its core. It opens in the glass, adding muscle and depth, ultimately developing into a complex and persistent wine that simply refuses to quit.",94,49,"Oregon","Chardonnay",43.8041334,-120.5542012,2
"10466","US","Two-plus years in the cellar have softened and mellowed this wine, taking off the edges and giving it a nice roundness. It's quite impressive, filled with classically varietal cherry, cola and sweet persimmon fruit, while that famous Russian River acidity gives it a boost of tartness. Drink this delicious, rich wine now–2016.",93,44,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10467","US","Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit is the whole story here. It's fresh, acidic, forward and spicy, then tails off quickly into a tannic finish. The last impression is of earth and stems, slightly bitter and astringent.",86,26,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10468","US","A little rough around the edges, with some irregular tannins and a few green notes, but otherwise fine and dry. The silky texture frames Life Saver cherry candy flavors.",86,35,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10469","US","A good, dry and flavorful Syrah, with lush blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's a harsh in the mouth, with some firm tannins, but a nice, fruity sipper to enjoy now.",86,33,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10470","US","Lots of oak on this five-year-old Syrah. Too much, in fact, although it may be that the cherry-berry fruit is simply dropping out. Either way, it's a fairly simple wine, dry and tart and spicy. Drink now.",86,25,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10471","US","This is classic Oregon Pinot Noir at its most svelte and stylish. Fresh and clean upon entry, it showcases its raspberry and cherry fruit in a delicate wrap of leaf and bark. The tannins are in perfect proportion; the finish is complex and intriguing.",93,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10472","US","This Syrah was grown and produced by the winery owners, and held back almost five years before release. That's an impressive act of courage, but it has benefited the consumer. The wine, while still somewhat tannic, feels mellow, with a complex array of black fruits and berries, grilled bacon, sweet tobacco, dark chocolate and, above all, freshly crushed black pepper. An impressive Syrah that should change in interesting ways over the next six years.",93,38,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10473","US","Stylish, precise, elegant and evocative, the Jessie may be the best of an excellent single-vineyard lineup from Cristom in 2009. Light toast rims deep black-fruit flavors, with excellent concentration. The lengthy finish brings in streaks of espresso and clean earth. This has the balance and detail to reward significant cellaring.",93,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10474","US","Although the Chestnut Hill selection from Lemelson remained stubbornly hard and tight after opening, it rewarded extra patience with added depth and polish. The red fruits showed the most concentration of all the 2009s from this producer, and oak accents of cinnamon and toast were beautifully integrated. A seamless middle and exceptional length mark this wine as one to cellar.",93,42,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10475","US","All the parts are here, but they're not yet in complete harmony. The black-currant flavor is strong and deep; the tannins are thick and dramatic; and the acidity is fresh and stimulating. Oak is evident, with notes of buttered cinnamon toast, and the finish is long and spicy. All indications are of a wine that needs serious time in the cellar. Give it until at least 2015.",93,82,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10476","US","A fruity, black cherry nose is accented with leather and forest floor scents. The flavors follow, with smoke and licorice wrapped into the black fruits. Tannins show black tea and a hint of bitterness.",86,30,"Oregon","Merlot",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10477","US","This vineyard select Pinot Noir shows some chocolate flavors around thin, sharp red berry fruit. The oak influence dominates, along with an earthy, tannic finish.",85,28,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10478","US","Heavy, soft and oaky. Gains points for richness of flavor, offering waves of cherries and raspberries, but it's top heavy in fruit, and the oak is too strong.",85,27,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10479","US","Light and thin in texture as well as flavor. Nice and dry, with pleasant strawberry and cranberry fruit and a touch of sweet oak. However, it lacks substance and complexity for the price. Drink now.",85,24,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10480","US","This wine, which is from the Napa side of the sprawling Carneros appellation, is superb. It's soft, rich and chocolaty, with a rich vein of ripe blackberries, but it also has a tannic structure and dry finish that make it balanced and complex. Drink now–2015.",93,60,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10481","US","Tastes of perfectly ripened pineapple, pear, lime and peach flavors. On the structural side is fine acidity and a tangy minerality, like a lick of cold steel. Oak is here, notable but perfectly integrated. Give this Chard a little time in the glass to breathe.",93,35,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10482","US","A lovely Cabernet, dry and dustily tannic, with a complex array of flavors. The black cherries and cola are accompanied by firm mineral and earthy notes that make this strikingly different from your typical fruit-forward Cabernet, but then, the alcohol is a modest 13.7% by volume. All indications are of ageability. Could age at least eight years in the cellar.",92,75,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10483","US","Just delicious, offering sweetly ripe blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with a rich coating of smoky oak. The all-important tannins are soft and gentle. Really a flamboyant, opulent wine, and probably showing its best in youth.",92,42,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10484","US","This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel.",92,42,"California","Merlot",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10485","US","With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness. It's also relatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that Napa doesn't produce much of anymore. All signs, including an intense concentration of blackberries and stone fruits, are that it's an ager. Cellar until 2017.",92,150,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10486","US","Lots to like in this ripe Chardonnay. It has fruit-forward pineapple, kiwi and apricot flavors, brightened with citrusy acidity, and enriched by sweet, smoky oak. A rich, elegant wine to drink now with lamb, ahi tuna or by itself as an appetizer.",92,32,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10487","US","A good followup to last year's bottling, although the wine isn't quite as ripe and lush. The cool vintage has brought out a tannic earthiness, as well as a blast of black pepper that makes the blackberry and blueberry fruit tingly on the tongue. It's a complicated, individualistic wine, and you might want to cellar it for up to six years and see what happens.",92,45,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10488","US","Creamy and polished, with good acidity and pleasant citrus, buttered popcorn and mineral flavors. Could be a little more complex.",85,20,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10489","US","Nicely dry and crisp, with some good pineapple flavors enriched with oak. Loses points, however, due to a certain vegetal character that's compounded by the fruit starting to fall out.",85,25,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10490","US","A bit too oaky and extracted. Trades these winemaker elaborations for the natural subtlety of the grapes. Rich in cherries and raspberries, but heavy-handed. Drink now.",85,35,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3

"10493","US","Showing lots more depth and focus than Husch's regular Pinot Noir, this wine comes from nearly 40-year-old grapes grown on the estate. It's charming, light and silky in the mouth, with brilliant acidity framing intense flavors of cherries and spices. Should age well for up to a decade.",92,40,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10494","US","Big for a Pinot Noir, but that's Santa Lucia and Tondre for you. It could almost be Grenache, but it sure is delicious. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, spices and oak; full-bodied, with some hefty tannins, but it never loses Pinot's essential silkiness. Drink now–2015.",92,50,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10495","US","There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing.",92,29,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10496","US","This is a vigorous young Cabernet, fresh and jammy in blackberry, cassis and new oak notes. The tannins are thick, smooth and flashy, and should protect the wine as it glides on its aging journey. Best after 2015.",92,44,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10497","US","A lovely Napa Cabernet, marked by ripe, rich flavors of blackberry and black currant and the smoky toast of oak barrel aging. Dry and tannic, it's a soothing, upscale Cabernet to drink over the next few years.",92,40,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10498","US","Winemaker Laurent Montalieu has outdone himself with the fruit from this heritage vineyard. Silky and deep, with a luscious mix of berries, it's a supple, seductive Pinot, wrapped in sleek layers of spicy, toasty oak.",92,35,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10499","US","One of the biggest, boldest, ripest Chardonnays in California, marked as usual by intense flavors, which the winemaker has boosted with oak. Just explodes in pineapple and apricot jam, tangerine custard and buttered toast, brightened by zesty acidity. The wine will age, gradually losing fruit and picking up roasted nut notes.",92,40,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10500","US","An everyday Chardonnay with a creamy texture and oak-inspired buttered toast notes. The underlying fruit has pineapple and orange flavors.",85,18,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10501","US","Here's a common, fruity Cabernet for everyday drinking. It's dryish and tart, with blackberry jam, plum and mocha flavors. Drink now.",85,18,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10502","US","Made in an oaky, creamy style to appeal to popular tastes, this Chardonnay has jammy pineapple flavors. It's brisk in acidity and is somewhat simple, but the price isn't bad.",85,16,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10503","US","Lots of rich flavors of blackberry, black currant, bacon, pepper and clove in this Syrah, which comes from the winery's big vineyard on Spring Mountain. Feels luxurious in the mouth, with a silky texture and a deep, long finish. It's a bit brusque in tannins, but that's part of its structural distinction. Drink it over the next few years.",92,55,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10504","US","This big, strong Cabernet insists on pushing its blackberry, currant, plum and cocoa flavors across the palate. It's not subtle, and doesn't apologize for it. The grapes are from various vineyards in St. Helena, a warmer part of Napa Valley, and you can taste the incredible ripeness as well as the softness of tannins and acids that make drinking it so pretty now.",92,85,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10505","US","There is a delicious, citrusy kick to this wine, lifting the bright berry fruit flavors. The flavors pile on, with peppery spice and chocolate, and a complex midpalate that tastes like cherry cola.",92,40,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10506","US","Smooth and already a seamless, complex and compelling whole, this estate-grown reserve overdelivers for the price. Roughly one-fifth new oak balances the modest alcohol, and the just-ripe berry and pomegranate fruit. Light hints of earth, coffee grounds and sassafras add further detail through a lingering finish.",91,36,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10507","US","This is a rich, delicious and balanced Pinot. It defines the modern California style, being dry, silky and ripe, showing a wealth of raspberry, cherry, cola, persimmon and spice flavors. Oak adds rich notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Drink this savory wine over the next few years.",91,50,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10508","US","So elegant and sophisticated, this is a great value in California Chardonnay. Although it's dry, it's rich and delicious in pineapples, pears, mangoes and honey, with an opulent overlay of sweet oak. The brisk acidity is balanced, and gets the mouth watering.",91,22,"California","Chardonnay",36.778261,-119.4179324,2
"10509","US","A lovely Canary Hill, though a bit lighter than previous vintages, this elegant, smoky wine offers tart wild-berry fruit with a lightly earthy foundation.",91,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10510","US","Ken Wright's 2010 Pinots keep the alcohol levels low without sacrificing any flavor or depth. The Nysa is a gorgeous color, aromatically rich with a bouquet of fruit and flowers. Fresh and primary flavors of ripe berry are set amid delicate tannins. The structure suggests excellent aging potential over a decade or more.",91,50,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10511","US","Nearing the age of four years, this Cabernet remains hefty in tannins, but it's not undrinkable, because those tannins are soft and lush. In fact, they're an integral part of the network that makes the wine so interesting, which also includes the classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries and cassis. Drink this elegant wine over the next six years.",91,60,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10512","US","Another entry into the under-$15 Oregon Pinot category, that has become rather crowded in the past year. This is a stiff, tannic wine, still knitting itself together, with vanilla cream-infused strawberry fruit, that only partially masks rather green, herbal tannins.",85,14,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10513","US","Earthy upon entry, with sub-notes suggesting some stem contact and slightly green tannins. Tart and spicy, with wild berry and pomegranate fruit, in a firmly focused, if short, wine.",85,20,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10514","US","Strawberry and raspberry fruit enter brightly, then quickly fall flat in the mouth. The wine is sound, but somehow lifeless, with a soft, quick fade.",85,24,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10515","US","Like its companion, Carpe Noctum, the Confero offers full flavors of cherry and berry, with spice and toast backing. Here the flavors are a touch lighter but perhaps more elegant and detailed, with suggestions of mint and caramel trickling through the finish.",91,34,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10516","US","Yummy, with ripe, plush berries running rampant across the tongue. The juicy acids and underlying minerality add lift and life, but the fruit, rolling from cranberry to boysenberry to blackberry, just won't let go. The structure suggests ageability for another decade of more.",91,30,"Oregon","Pinot Noir",43.8041334,-120.5542012,3
"10517","US","Textbook Napa Cab. It's dry, smoothly tannic and subtle, with blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors nicely intrigued with herbs, tobacco and cedar. Just delicious now and for the next few years.",91,28,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10518","US","A decadent, dark and meaty Syrah, with plenty of sauvage tendencies amid a rich, velvety texture that finishes long and lushly perfumed with sweet smoke. In a cool year in El Dorado, Lava Cap has reined in this Syrah's tannins and let its dark cherry and plum flavors take center stage.",91,21,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10519","US","A little soft and herbal, in the way of certain Sonoma Cabernets, but incredibly rich, offering a heady array of flavors. Blackberries, blueberries, chocolate, sweet red licorice, pepper and toasty oak all mingle and make the wine rewardingly delicious. Seems best now and for the next few years.",91,30,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10520","US","Rather acidic now, giving a sweet and sour taste to the cherry, raspberry and oak flavors. On the plus side is dryness and silkiness.",85,34,"California","Pinot Noir",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10521","US","A problematic wine marked by excessive acidity that makes it tart, almost sour, despite some good blackberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are soft, making the acidity taste unnatural.",85,20,"California","Syrah",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
"10522","US","Creamy and a little unripe, with a vegetal edge to the citrus and pear flavors. It's dry, acidic and clean. Works for everyday fare.",84,25,"California","Sauvignon Blanc",36.778261,-119.4179324,3
